Personal information is defined broadly under PIPEDA as any information about an identifiable individual, such as their name, address, email, phone number, date of birth, social insurance number, driver's license, or blood type. PIPEDA also includes sensitive data, such as an individual's ethnic origin, social status, and personal health information.

Under PIPEDA, organizations are required to obtain an individual's consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information, except in certain circumstances, such as when the information is required by law or in an emergency. Organizations must also limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information to what is necessary for their stated purposes and must ensure that the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

Additionally, PIPEDA requires organizations to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, or retention. This includes physical, organizational, and technological security measures, such as secure storage facilities, access controls, and encryption.

Finally, individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to request that any inaccuracies be corrected. They also have the right to file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) if they believe that their privacy rights have been violated. In cases of a data breach, organizations are required to notify affected individuals and the OPC, and may face disciplinary actions if they are found to be non-compliant with PIPEDA.

In comparison to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), PIPEDA provides similar protections for personal information, but is generally considered to be less strict in its requirements. However, as data privacy continues to be a significant privacy issue for Canadians, the OPC continues to monitor PIPEDA compliance and make recommendations for improvements to privacy legislation.</div>
