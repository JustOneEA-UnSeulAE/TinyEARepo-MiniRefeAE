						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Employment and Social Development Canada&#8217;s Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is the largest information technology project undertaken to date by the federal government. The programme had 2 key goals:
&#8226; migrate Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, and Canada Pension Plan benefits to a modern cloud&#8209;based platform
&#8226; transform benefits delivery and the user experience to meet the needs of diverse groups, including seniors, people in remote locations, Indigenous peoples, and refugees
The information technology systems currently used to deliver these benefits to Canadians are between 20 and 60 years old and at risk of failing. If these systems were to fail, it could greatly affect the more than 10 million Canadians who rely on them to meet their daily needs.
We found that in the face of ongoing delays, cost increases, and staffing challenges, the department showed flexibility by adjusting its approach from working on both of the programme&#8217;s goals in tandem to prioritizing the migration of the aging systems to reduce the risk of system failure. However, this approach meant delaying the programme&#8217;s much&#8209;needed transformation component, which is intended to improve how people access and receive these benefits, including reducing the occurrence of inaccurate payments. The programme is more than halfway into its initially planned timeline, and all 3 benefits are still operating on outdated systems with limitations.
As time goes on and estimated costs continue to rise, we are concerned that decision makers may scale back or eliminate the transformation component of the 3 benefits, resulting in a final product that does not consider the needs of millions of Canadians who rely on them. The Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is an opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate how it could improve the planning and execution of large, multi&#8209;year information technology projects.</div>
