CYBERSECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE CLOUD
Federal government must strengthen its use of controls to prevent, detect, and respond to threats on personal information stored in the cloud
Report 7 | Reports of the Auditor General of Canada

At a Glance
Information stored digitally, whether on-premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised. Overall, we found that the requirements the government had in place to reduce the security risks of storing information in the cloud were not always followed by the departments we audited. In addition, these requirements and their corresponding roles and responsibilities were not always clear, resulting in inconsistent implementation and increased risks. This is important because the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has directed departments to consider moving applications and databases to the cloud, so increasing amounts of Canadians&#8217; personal information are moving there. At the same time, cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The risk of significant impacts on the government and its operations is growing.

The government must take immediate action to strengthen how it prevents, detects, and responds to cyberattacks. It should do this now, while departments are still in the early stages of moving personal information to the cloud. This action includes strengthening key security controls to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches. It also includes clarifying shared roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity&#8212;which are highly complex in a cloud environment&#8212;so that all departments know exactly what they should be doing.

We also found that, 4 years after the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat first directed departments to consider moving to the cloud, it had still not provided a long-term funding approach for cloud adoption. It had also not given departments tools to calculate the costs of moving to or of operating in the cloud and securing the information stored in it. Departments need both a funding approach and costing tools to ensure that the people, expertise, skills, training, funding, and other resources they need to secure cloud-based information are available to prevent and address the greatest threats and risks. A funding approach and costing tools are essential for cloud adoption and would strengthen Canada&#8217;s cyber-defence capabilities both at the departmental level and government-wide.

   Why we did this audit

Information stored digitally, whether on&#8209;premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised.
Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians&#8217; personal information. Departments must work together to protect this information from a number of risks, including cyberattacks.
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise, and strong controls to prevent, detect, and respond to them can reduce the risk of breaches.
   Our findings

There were weaknesses in departments&#8217; controls for preventing, detecting, and responding to cyberattacks.
The roles and responsibilities for ensuring cloud cybersecurity were unclear and incomplete.
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat did not provide departments with a costing model or funding approach for cloud services.
Public Services and Procurement Canada and Shared Services Canada did not include environmental criteria in their procurement of cloud services.
   Key facts and figures

Departmental spending on cloud services government-wide has increased significantly year over year, from $35 million in 2018 to almost $120 million in 2021.
Digital technologies are expected to be responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and for up to 14% by 2040.
The 3 departments we selected for this audit were using a variety of short-term funding measures to support their cloud and cybersecurity operations, including reallocating funds that had been intended for other purposes.

   Highlights of our recommendations

In consultation with Shared Services Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should clarify who is responsible for the initial validation and ongoing monitoring of cloud guardrail controls.
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should ensure that the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan applies to the evolving cloud environment and shared responsibilities, review and test it at least annually, and update it as needed.
In consultation with Shared Services Canada and other departments, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should develop and provide a costing model to help departments make informed decisions about moving to the cloud and Help departments determine their long-term operational funding needs.</div>
