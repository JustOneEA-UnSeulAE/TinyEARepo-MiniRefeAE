Description: This bank describes information used to communicate with individuals external to the institution and may include general inquiries (received by e-mail, telephone, mail) and responses, the distribution of public awareness and communications material, the dissemination of reports, publications, and other documentation including the release of previously released access to information packages (informal access requests), success stories, public opinion research, and information posted to social media platforms including wikis, blogs, and other collaborative Internet technologies used or hosted by the institution. Personal information may include name, contact information, user names and passwords, employee personnel information, biographical information, photographs, video and audio recordings, views and opinions of, or about, individuals, and Internet Protocol (IP) routing addresses.

Note: This information may be stored in either hard copy format or electronically (e.g., in databases or on Web sites, including social media applications, etc.). Although Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are not specifically requested by an institution, they may be captured electronically when an email is received. Description last updated: December 2013 .

Class of Individuals: Members of the public, representatives of private sector organizations and other government institutions (i.e., municipal, provincial/territorial, and international), employees and other representatives of government institutions, who have requested information from, or submitted information to, a government institution; parents and guardians of minors; employees and other individuals with access to institutional networks, including individuals who have prepared information for dissemination, such as publication on the institution&#8217;s extranet or internet sites or who act as contact points within the institution.

Purpose: Personal information is used to disseminate information about the functions, programs, and activities of the institution, including about employees of the institution. For many institutions, personal information is collected under the authority of the Financial Administration Act (FAA), and in accordance with the Communications Policy of the Government of Canada. For those institutions not subject to the FAA or the Communications Policy of the Government of Canada, consult the institution&#8217;s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator to determine collection authority.

Consistent Uses: The names, photographs, recordings and other personal information about individuals who work for the institution may be included in documentation posted on the institution&#8217;s extranet or Internet sites; e.g., within speeches, newsletters, etc. With consent of the individual, information may be shared with other areas of the institution for program-specific mailing/distribution lists and/or telephone lists. Information may be used to moderate public discussion on the social media platforms used by the institution. Responses to enquiries and any other relevant information are accounted for by the institution-specific personal information bank related to the program area that sent the response. Requests for information may be transferred when the requested information, e.g., inquiry or complaint, falls under the responsibility of another institution, refer to Executive Correspondence - PSU 902 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu902).
