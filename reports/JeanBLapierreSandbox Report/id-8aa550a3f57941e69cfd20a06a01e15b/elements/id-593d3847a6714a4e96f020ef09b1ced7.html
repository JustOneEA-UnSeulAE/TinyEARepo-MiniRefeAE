The Throne Speech shows bold vision &#8211; but success requires strong public services
Prime Minister Mark Carney has set an ambitious agenda to protect Canada, and we welcome it. His government is facing new and unprecedented challenges: economic uncertainty, global instability, trade disruptions, and threats to Canadian sovereignty. As King Charles III noted in the historic Speech from the Throne, "the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War."

The scale of the government's ambitions is impressive. From building the strongest economy in the G7 to doubling the rate of home construction, from eliminating internal trade barriers by Canada Day to cutting project approval times from 5 years to 2 &#8211; this is the kind of bold leadership Canada needs right now.

Ambition without capacity is just talk
But here's the reality: you can't deliver on more goals with fewer tools. The Throne Speech promises transformational change while simultaneously pledging to cap the public service and cut operating budgets. This contradiction undermines the government's own agenda.

Building a stronger, more resilient Canada means investing in the public service to succeed. Our members are the quiet force behind Canada's strength &#8211; dedicated professionals who protect the health, safety, and economic security of Canadians by building the systems we all rely on when times get tough.

Take the Major Federal Project Office, which will cut approval times in half while "upholding Canada's world-leading environmental standards." Who will staff these accelerated reviews? Scientists, engineers, policy analysts, and regulatory experts &#8211; the very public servants whose numbers the government plans to cap.

Public services: Canada's anchor in uncertain times
In a volatile world, the public service is Canada&#8217;s stabilizer. They are the engine behind our economy, our infrastructure, and our national security. They provide safety nets, protect public health, and ensure no one is left behind.

The Throne Speech acknowledges that "many Canadians are struggling to get ahead" and promises help through programs like the Canadian Dental Care Plan, Pharmacare, and child care. But these programs don't run themselves &#8211; they require skilled public servants to design, deliver, and improve them.

You cannot protect Canadians by weakening the institutions they rely on.

We've been here before &#8211; and we delivered
PIPSC members have a long history of stepping up in times of crisis. During COVID-19, our members were:

Designing and delivering emergency benefit programs that kept families afloat
Working in labs to develop mass COVID testing methods
Keeping government systems running so Canadians could access support
Training nurses to manage outbreaks and bringing Canadians home from abroad
Our expertise didn't just help manage the crisis &#8211; it helped lead the recovery.

This moment is no different. Whether it's implementing the new border security measures outlined in the Speech, supporting the creation of Build Canada Homes, or helping deliver on the promise to remove internal trade barriers, our members will be there.

Ready to partner for Canada's success
We're not just raising concerns &#8211; we're offering partnership. PIPSC members are ready to do their part to deliver on this ambitious agenda, just as we always have.

But that requires investment in people and services &#8211; not cuts, caps, or constraints. Prime Minister Carney's expanded cabinet shows the government understands the scope of the work ahead. Now they need to ensure the public service has the capacity to match that ambition.

We're here for Canada. Built to serve, ready to protect.
The question is: will the government give us the tools we need to deliver the Canada they've promised?
