						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">1. Identify your reader and your objectives
Ask:

Who are your readers?
Why are you writing to them?
What do they want to know?
What action do they want to perform?
Example: Identify your reader and your objectives
Before:
Much of the history that we celebrate surrounds the voyageurs and the fur trade none of which may have transpired without the seemingly herculean efforts of courageous explorers like Cartier and Champlain but that still doesn't answer the original question "Why is the park named after Samuel de Champlain?"

Author's name
Taken from Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park Information Guide 2015
After:
"Come explore Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park and find out why this park takes his name" or "Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park&#8212;Explore the land Champlain discovered".

2. Organize your ideas
Make an outline of your ideas.
Put important information first.
Organize the rest of the information in a logical order.
Put extra information at the end, and keep only if relevant.
Create headings and subheadings.
Use the inverted pyramid.
inverted pyramid: Most newsworthy info
Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?, Important details, Other info
Example: Organize your ideas
Before:
The forms you submitted to act as a third-party administrator will be carefully reviewed and assessed before an individual's, agency's or organization's request for trusteeship is granted or declined. It is important to note that Service Canada-appointed trustees and organizations undertake the responsibility to administer benefits in the best interest of the individuals they represent. When the review is complete, Service Canada will contact you to advise you if your request to act as a third-party administrator has been granted.

Taken from an ESDC letter to Canadians
After:
Reviewing your request : Thank you for your application. A committee will review your request to be a third-party administrator and make a decision based on all the details you have provided.

Receiving an answer: Once the committee reaches a decision, a Service Canada representative will contact you to give you the results.

Note: [or remove this text altogether]

3. Use everyday words

How sentences sometimes get inflated
In a circle: You to Colleagues to Senior managers to Policy to Program to Legal to ADMO to MO to You...
From this...
In 2012, 500 new Canadians were able to find the jobs they wanted by enrolling in the Foreign Credential Recognition Program. (21 words)

To this... in no time!
In 2012, the reporting of the Statistics Canada study entitled "New Canadians and foreign credential recognition in Canada: The numbers for 2012 &#8211; A case study," among others, stipulated ipso facto that the filling of various employment opportunities that were sought by some 500 new Canadians who emigrated to Canada during the said period from across the globe came about through their enrolment in the federal government's Employment and Social Development's Foreign Credential Recognition Program, notwithstanding other circumstances that may have contributed to the situation. (84 words!)

4. Avoid noun strings, jargon and inflated language
Avoid strings of three or more nouns:
Break up strings or rewrite by using alternate words to explain.
Avoid meaningless, formal or bureaucratic language or jargon:
Use simple words to explain complicated ideas.
Use specific examples to help illustrate complicated concepts.
Example: Avoid noun strings, jargon and inflated language

Hemingway
Example: Write short, simple sentences
Before:
It is your responsibility to contact your loan providers to set up a repayment schedule before you have to start making payments after the six month non- repayment period, even though loan providers will try to contact you via mail or phone; it is still your obligation to set up and manage your loan payments should they not be able to reach you. (F-K = 26.5, G-F = 30)

After (better):
It is your responsibility to contact your loan providers to set up a repayment schedule before the six month non-repayment period is over. Loan providers will try to contact you by mail or phone, but it is your obligation to set up and manage your loan payments. (F-K = 11.3, G-F = 15.5)

After (better still):
It is up to you to repay your loan. You must contact your loan provider(s) before the six month non-repayment period is over to set up how and when you will repay your loan. (F-K = 6.8, G-F = 10.5)

10. Use formatting and layout to highlight your information and keep your reader's attention
Highlight important text.
Use headings and sub-headings.
Use relevant and meaningful images when appropriate.
Include colour to draw attention and create interest.
Leave some white space.
Choose your font wisely.
Use tables to display data when appropriate.
Increase the accessibility* of your texts.
Suggestions to increase accessibility
Fonts:
Use sans-serif fonts (e.g. Arial, Verdana) for web content, size 12.
Formatting:
Include space in your layout, bolded text and bullets for emphasis.
Avoid columns, italics, text boxes and tables, if they can be replaced by simple formatting instead.
Always apply heading styles to titles and subtitles and apply table headers to your table cells (using options in Word).
Colour:
Use high contrast colours for text and background, and use patterns along with contrasting colours in tables and graphs.

See Color Contrast Testerand Color Contrast Spectrum to test combinations and WCAG 2.1 section 1.41. Use of Color for criteria.

Images, tables and graphs:
Provide a) Alternative text (Alt text) or b) good captions and longer descriptions within the text body, below the images.

Alt text
Add a brief Alt text to all images and objects, if different from the caption or if no caption is included:

Format picture, Alt Text configuration window
Right click your image/object
Select Format Picture/ Object/Chart Area; or select Table Properties for tables
Select Alt Text
Fill in a brief Description
Make sure you answer the question "what information is the image or object conveying?"
