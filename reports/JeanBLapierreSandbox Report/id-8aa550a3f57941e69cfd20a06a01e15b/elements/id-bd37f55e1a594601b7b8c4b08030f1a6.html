Determining whether your business needs to comply with the PIPEDA principles depends on several factors, and it's crucial to seek legal advice for a definitive answer, especially considering the potential updates anticipated in 2024. However, here's a general overview based on current regulations:

You likely need to comply with PIPEDA if:

You operate a private-sector organization within Canada.
Your business collects, uses, or discloses personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) in the course of commercial activities.
You likely don't need to comply with PIPEDA if:

Your organization is non-profit or primarily engages in non-commercial activities.
Your business is based outside of Canada.
You don't collect, use, or disclose personal information.
However, even if PIPEDA doesn't directly apply to your business, it's recommended to follow its principles as best practices to demonstrate responsible data handling and build trust with customers.

Nevertheless, based on general case law, it can be inferred that Canada's data protection law extends to foreign organizations that possess a genuine and significant connection to the country.

According to Section 4 of PIPEDA, it applies to personal information that:

Any organization collects, uses, or discloses for commercial purposes, or
Identifies an employee or job applicant.
It explicitly does not apply to:

Government institutions
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for personal or domestic purposes, and
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) has determined that PIPEDA applies to foreign businesses when they handle the personal information of Canadians.

For example, in the 411Numbers case, the OPC concluded that PIPEDA is applicable to a business that has a genuine and significant connection to Canada. This connection could be based on factors such as whether the business processes the personal data of Canadians, whether its privacy practices could affect Canadians, whether they promote its products and services in Canada, and similar considerations.</div>
