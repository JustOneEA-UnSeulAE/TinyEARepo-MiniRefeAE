Carney's singular mandate letter a welcome change, promises 'narrow' focus for upcoming Parliament, say insiders
By: Marco Vigliotti

Prime Minister Mark Carney released his mandate letter to cabinet on Wednesday, spelling out a broad list of priorities for his re-elected Liberal government, including establishing a new economic and security relationship with the U.S., removing internal trade barriers and reducing costs for Canadians.

It represents a break from the tradition established by Justin Trudeau, where each minister received instructions unique to their portfolio.

Carney said Canadians "elected a new government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone," and his cabinet "must fulfill this mandate with purpose and force."

"We must meet a series of unprecedented challenges with both a disciplined focus on core priorities and new approaches to governing."

Carney's seven priorities for cabinet are mostly restated commitments from the this past spring's election campaign, including safeguarding Canadian sovereignty by bolstering border security and strengthening the military, returning immigration rates to "sustainable levels," reducing spending on government operations, and spurring home construction through public-private cooperation (via the creation of new federal body Build Canada Homes) and investments in the skilled trades.

Carney said Canada "faces a series of crises," while the global trading system - a source of the country's prosperity for decades - undergoes the "biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall."

He blamed "longstanding weak productivity" for "straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely."

"The new federal government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing," Carney writes.

"We must redefine Canada's international, commercial, and security relationships. In the process, we need to develop a defence industrial policy that secures Canada, fulfills our responsibilities to our allies, and helps build our economy."

Carlene Variyan, a former chief of staff in the Trudeau government, said Carney's mandate letter was a "very effective way" of signalling that this new cabinet has "a narrow and disciplined focus in a time of perceived crisis."

"A lot of people who have served in government and were involved in the drafting of mandate letters probably thought yesterday 'why didn't I think of that?' It's quite clever," she told iPolitics.

Variyan, an associate vice-president with Summa Strategies, also said the streamlined focus of the mandate letter contrasts sharply with the 73-member strong shadow cabinet and leadership team unveiled by the Conservatives on Wednesday. Carney's cabinet, unveiled last week, boasts 29 cabinet ministers and 10 secretaries of state.

Erin Morrison, who previously served as Jagmeet Singh's director of communications, said the mandate letter provides an opportunity for the hobbled NDP, which took only 7 seats in the April 28 vote, losing official party status.

She said Carney's priorities "make it clear that this is a Liberal Party that's moving quite a bit to the right," pointing to his calls to reduce spending and using private-public partnerships to support new housing construction.

"[This is] further right than than we ever seen the Liberal Party. Among his seven priorities, he's got cuts and the P3 (public-private partnership) form of privatization, the things that really are at the core of of the NDP working with the labor movement and the progressive movements in Canada," said Morrison, principal of Morrison Comms and acting vice president of Texture Communications.

"I do not think Canadians will be immediately insulted or upset by Carney's priority list, but I do think the NDP will read it with the insight it needs, and then start picking it apart."

Morrison said she expects the NDP to "punch above its weight" in the next session of Parliament, providing a counter-weight to Carney's policies that appear to be similar to those advanced by the Conservatives.

She credited interim leader Don Davies as "super smart" and a "powerful speaker," and anticipated that the party will emerge with a "unified plan and vision," compared to the "adrift" Conservative caucus that seems to be debating its future direction after struggling to contrast against the more centre-right Carney during the campaign.

"They're not clear on what they're criticizing anymore because the Liberals match all their policies. They agree on everything. So, you know, what is there to ask about in question period? Who can axe the tax faster? I think they're now at a loss."

Variyan said it's unfair to label Carney as leading a centre-right government, pointing to campaign pledges to protect programs like pharmacare and dentalcare, and invest in universal child care.

"Those are very much commitments reflective of a progressive party that wants to form a progressive government. There is nothing in the language of that mandate letter that excludes progressive action to do things like broaden the social safety net. Nothing in that mandate letter that blocks further steps toward embracing an energy transition or reconciliation with Indigenous peoples," she said.

"This very streamlined, singular mandate letter is going to be met with some surprise and some trepidation from stakeholders of government because it's not the way that we're used to doing things. Over the past 10 years, it's become a very useful tool for holding ministers accountable to the things that they were assigned to do, and holding governments accountable. We're not used to having a prime minister set out such a streamlined list of priorities, but it will not fundamentally change the government's approach to implementing the platform that it was elected on."

Conservative strategist Kate Harrison said while the mandate letter does touch upon some Conservative demands, how the Liberals address these concerns will open up opportunities for the Tories.

"You know [Conservative Leader] Pierre Poilievre invited the prime minister to steal his ideas, and it appears that's happening to some extent in terms of the areas of focus [in the mandate letter]," she said.

"I think that the issue will be all about implementation. So, there's talk in the mandate letter about the importance of housing. Well, Conservatives would dispute that more government built housing is the way that you improve affordability. A new agency to deal with this, is that what we need, or is it more removal of red tape? So I think that there will be room to quibble with the how some of these things are done."

Harrison, a vice-chair at Summa, acknowledged that Carney's streamlined mandate latter could help "cabinet stay stay focused and keep their eye on the prize," saying the former Trudeau front bench struggled because they had "arguably too many priorities" and were "spread too thin" to be effective.

But she said the Liberals missed an opportunity to hog the spotlight and take advantage of the Poilievre being absent from the Commons by slow-walking the start of their term, highlighted by the refusal to bring in a budget this spring.

"These are really key opportunities for the Opposition to kind of show how they would be different and how they would do things differently. But, the government doesn't seem to be in a rush to want to prioritize those those things. And so I'm not sure that the Conservatives and Poilievre are missing much of an opportunity, at least in the in terms of the next few months."

Mandate letter priorities
1. Establishing a new economic and security relationship with the United States and strengthening our collaboration with reliable trading partners and allies around the world.
2. Building one Canadian economy by removing barriers to interprovincial trade and identifying and expediting nation-building projects that will connect and transform our country.
3. Bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them to get ahead.
4. Making housing more affordable by unleashing the power of public-private cooperation, catalysing a modern housing industry, and creating new careers in the skilled trades.
5. Protecting Canadian sovereignty and keeping Canadians safe by strengthening the Canadian Armed Forces, securing our borders, and reinforcing law enforcement.
6. Attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.
7. Spending less on government operations so that Canadians can invest more in the people and businesses that will build the strongest economy in the G7.
