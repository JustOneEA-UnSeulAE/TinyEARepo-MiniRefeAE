Despite the increasing use of AI in Canada, levels of mistrust in AI and its use are high. In public consultations on the AI Strategy, participants expressed a desire for more engagement in the process of designing and developing government AI systems, especially by those more greatly impacted by algorithmic bias or barriers to access. They asked for greater transparency about the government&#8217;s AI use through labelling of AI-generated products and information on systems in use, and for information about ways to seek explanations or recourse for decisions.

Key actions
Strengthen accountability and transparency on AI use
The Government of Canada will continue to strengthen and clarify accountabilities for AI use in policy and in notifications about AI use. These will include new requirements and standard language for the disclosure of AI use, explanations of how an AI system reaches a decision, and information about rights and protections, including how to seek explanations or recourse and how to report problems. Lastly, the Government of Canada will identify those AI capabilities that it will not pursue.

As part of these efforts, the Government of Canada will prioritize the establishment of a public register of its AI systems. The register will include information about all AI systems that fall within a defined scope, drawing wherever possible on information already collected through Algorithmic Impact Assessments and Personal Information Banks. The scope of the register will be defined and publicized on the register itself and will follow best practice for registers in other jurisdictions, which exclude embedded AI systems and any systems covered by specific policy prohibiting publication. The register will include information about what and how data is being used, how it was trained, and what quality assurance and privacy and security measures are in place. Where information about systems cannot be published, the Government of Canada will develop and publish alternative oversight processes.

Demonstrate impact and value to Canadians
To ensure good stewardship of public resources, the Government of Canada will develop metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate the impact and value of AI initiatives to those we serve. This will track both the cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of AI projects through a range of financial and non-monetary metrics, including costs of implementation, efficiencies and cost savings achieved, service improvements, increased client satisfaction, or increased program uptake.

The Government of Canada will also develop a framework to track AI adoption. This framework will incorporate metrics for the deployment of AI solutions overall, but also for metrics such as collaboration, sharing, or scaling of solutions to avoid duplication of effort, maximize investment, and reduce costs. The metrics will also track departmental investments in the enablers of AI, including data, infrastructure, and talent.

Commit to engagement on AI
In keeping with its commitments to meaningful public engagement through the Directive on Open Government, and with the duty to consult, the Government of Canada commits to early and meaningful public and stakeholder engagement on AI initiatives of significant public interest or concern. This will include targeted engagement of communities that face greater impacts, risks or barriers from AI systems and union and employee engagement on workforce impacts. It will also include client participation in system design to ensure that AI systems do not create or perpetuate barriers to access for clients. The Government of Canada will also provide mechanisms for ongoing public feedback and questions on AI used by the federal government.

Learn more about: Public AI registers
Public AI registers are standardized, searchable databases that document the decisions, assumptions, and processes involved in the lifecycle of AI algorithms used by government organizations. AI registers usually include:

A non-technical overview of the AI application&#8217;s goals, use cases, and impacts.
The organizations responsible for the system.
Stage and date of system development.
Some registers also include information on

Data origins, management, processing, and quality issues.
Model architecture, key features, parameters, performance, and source code.
Bias, accessibility, and how those impacted were involved in system development.
Risk levels and mitigation, risk-benefit trade-offs, and impact assessments.
Human oversight in development, decision cycles, and monitoring.
How those impacted can seek an explanation for decisions.
Relevant privacy policies, information and system governance models, supplier contracts, and audit reports.
Most registers exclude AI that is embedded within commercial products, such as virtual assistants or spell checkers, but encourage organizations to default to reporting systems if unsure whether they qualify. They also exclude systems that fall under law or policy prohibiting public disclosure, which may be reported to oversight bodies instead.

From 2020 to 2024, under Executive Order 14110, the US government required all federal agencies to publish an annual inventory of their planned, new, and existing AI use cases, with exclusions only for very simple rule-based systems, robotic process automation, and defence systems. Other jurisdictions with AI registers include the Netherlands and Scotland, state governments of Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Catalonia, and municipalities of Amsterdam, Helsinki and San Jose.</div>
