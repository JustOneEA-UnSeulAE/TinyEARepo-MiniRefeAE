Description: This bank describes information used in the identification and selection of individuals to fill positions on institutional Boards, Committees and Councils. The personal information collected may include the following: full name, contact information, official language of choice, date of birth, country of birth, citizenship, gender, marital status, belonging to a minority, Social Insurance Number (SIN), unique identification number (e.g., unique employee number), terms and conditions of appointment including remuneration (e.g., salary, honoraria, per diem rate) and benefits, signature, physical limitations and any other relevant medical information, photographs or other image recordings, educational background, employment status, work history, volunteering history, professional affiliations, credit card and financial institution information, government security clearances, biographical information (including information about family members), conflict of interest declarations, letters of reference/recommendation, appointment date, and duration and resignation dates, if applicable.

Class of Individuals: Candidates, as well as current and former members of Boards, Committees, and Councils, their family members, and individuals whose names have been provided as personal references.

Purpose: The personal information collected is used to support the identification and selection of individuals to serve on advisory, oversight or governance bodies. The information may be used to provide advice to the Minister or Head of the institution to fill existing and/or forthcoming vacancies and to maintain an inventory of potential candidates. The personal information is also used to manage the administration of expenses (e.g., travel) and compensation and benefits packages, conduct performance evaluations, maintain an inventory of current and former appointees, record potential conflicts of interest and any compliance action required, and to communicate with these individuals. The authority to collect personal information is found in a number of legislative authorities such as section 9 Department of Employment and Social Development Act and section 22 of the Museums Act. The Social Insurance Number is collected pursuant to the Income Tax Act. Please consult the institution&#8217;s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator to determine the legal authority for the collection by a specific government institution.

With consent of the individual, this information may be shared with other Government of Canada institutions for uses consistent with the mandate of the Board, Committee or Council on which personal information is collected to fill positions (Refer to Members of Boards, Committees and Councils &#8211; PSU 919 of the specific government institution). Information may be disclosed to the Canada Revenue Agency (refer to Individual Returns and Payment Processing &#8211; CRA PPU 005 (http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/tp/nfsrc/nfsrc-eng.html)) and, where applicable, the Province of Quebec for income tax purposes. Assistance of third party service providers may be used during the selection process.
