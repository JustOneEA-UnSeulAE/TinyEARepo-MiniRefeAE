In October 2022, the government launched the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to disability inclusion. Community engagement is a key aspect&#8212;the government needs to get views from Canadians with disabilities in matters that affect them. To further enhance disability inclusion in Canada:

Budget 2023 proposes to provide $10 million over two years, beginning in 2023-24, to Employment and Social Development Canada to help address the unique needs and ongoing barriers faced by persons with disabilities by investing in capacity building and the community-level work of Canada's disability organizations.

Budget 2023 proposes to provide $21.5 million in 2023-24 to Employment and Social Development Canada to continue work on the future delivery of the Canada Disability Benefit, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process.

The government remains committed to the launch of a Canada Disability Benefit as part of the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process. Investments in Budget 2023 continue to lay the necessary groundwork for the Canada Disability Benefit, building off of the government's reintroduction of the Canada Disability Benefit Act in June 2022.

Supporting Canadians With Disabilities
The federal government provides significant support to Canadians with disabilities. This includes:

More than $1.6 billion per year to support persons with severe and prolonged mental and physical impairments through the Disability Tax Credit;

Over $1 billion per year through Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds, as well as exempting from tax investment income earned in Registered Disability Savings Plans, which supports the financial security of persons with disabilities;

Providing $922 million to provinces and territories through the Workforce Development Agreements in 2023-24, approximately 30 per cent of which is targeted to help persons with disabilities get training, develop their skills, and gain work experience;

Over $650 million annually through more generous Canada Student Grants, interest-free Canada Student Loans, and easier-to-access repayment assistance&#8212;including loan forgiveness for those with severe permanent disabilities&#8212;to support persons with disabilities with the additional costs of post-secondary education, such as those that come with supportive services and devices;

$105 million in 2023-24 to support the implementation of an employment strategy for persons with disabilities through the Opportunities Fund. This included funding to the Ready, Willing and Able Program to support persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder or intellectual disabilities in finding employment; and

Over $460 million per year through the Child Disability Benefit provided as a supplement to the Canada Child Benefit for parents of children with severe and prolonged disabilities, providing an average of approximately $2,700 in annual support.

Along with the proposed Canada Disability Benefit Act, these measures form part of the government's Disability Inclusion Action Plan, which aims to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities.</div>
