Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians. The Department collects, manages, and uses vast amounts of data every day&#8212;in everything from service delivery to policy and program development. Equipping the right people with the right insights to make the right decisions at the right time across the Department is key to better understanding our clients and how we make a difference in Canadians&#8217; lives from coast to coast to coast. At the same time, it ensures that we get the most value from data while mitigating risks to Canadians. 

The objective of the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is to bring ESDC further along the path towards achieving better services and outcomes for all Canadians. The Strategy aims to empower departmental employees to collectively treat data as enterprise assets, grounded in a culture of data stewardship and collaboration, that spans across policy analysis and research throughto evaluation and reporting back to Canadians. It outlines enterprise direction for equipping employees with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to deliver on the organizational mandate. It also supports us in strengthening our ability to monitor our programs, enhance operational efficiencies and leverage and adapt to changing technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Progress made in implementing the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy will also support ESDC&#8217;s first AI Strategy, as well as the advancement of the Government of Canada&#8217;s 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service and establishment of Canada&#8217;s first AI Strategy. On all of these fronts, our effortswill be rooted in a human-centric approach based on human rights, transparency, openness, and respect for the protection of personal information.

At the core of creating a seamless client service experience and generating value for Canadians is the ability to manage, find, understand, trust, share and use data as corporate and strategic assets. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is centered on four key Service Areas &#8211; Data Innovation, Data Governance and Trust, Data Culture and Literacy, and Foundational Data Infrastructure. Focusing on these Service Areas will enable the Department toidentify and manage opportunities and risks, while helping us to implement improvements that allow for the scaling of advanced data and analytical methods. 

The world is changing rapidly, the status quo is no longer adequate, and ESDC must be agile to meet these challenges head on. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy lays down the foundation for the future of datadriven work at ESDC. The Strategy is designed to evolve as new opportunities and priorities arise. As technologies and advanced methods evolve, the Strategy positions us to continue to execute on our commitment to the responsible and innovative use of data to realize wide-ranging benefits across the Department. It also sets the direction on how we continue to leverage data efficiently to drive key initiatives that improve programs and service delivery, to support modernization and transformation initiatives, and to measure our impact and results on the lives of Canadians.</div>
