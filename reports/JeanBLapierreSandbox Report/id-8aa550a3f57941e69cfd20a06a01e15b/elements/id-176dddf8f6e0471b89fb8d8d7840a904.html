Note: This standard personal information bank was terminated since all personal information retained in the systems is accounted for in personal information banks or classes of personal information of the programs or activities for which it was collected. Description terminated: December 2013 .

Business Continuity Planning
Description: This bank describes information that is used in support of Business Continuity Management functions which include the development and timely execution of plans, measures and procedures to minimize interruption to the availability of critical services and assets in the event of an emergency or disruption of service. Personal information may include: name, contact information, biographical information, employee personnel information and medical information. Personal information may also include the names and contact information of individuals identified by employees as emergency contacts.

Class of Individuals: Employees of the government institution; Ministers and exempt staff and other personnel of offices of Ministers or Ministers of State; emergency contacts identified by employees; private sector emergency response officials and service providers; and other federal, provincial or municipal officials who may need to be contacted in the event of an emergency or disruption of services.

Purpose: Personal information is used to plan and respond in a timely and effective manner to an emergency or to a disruption of service, to establish a list of employees, appropriate officials and their contact information. The list may be used to contact such individuals in the event of an emergency or the execution of the Business Continuity Plan. Some institutions may also require that supervisors maintain a list of direct reports, home telephone numbers and the emergency contacts identified by the direct reports. For most government institutions, personal information is collected pursuant to the Financial Administration Act (as required under the Policy on Government Security) and the Emergency Management Act. For those institutions not subject to these Acts, consult the institution&#8217;s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator to determine the legal authority for the collection.

Consistent Uses: Information may be shared with other federal, provincial, and municipal institutions, police, fire and other emergency response agencies as required. Some information may be shared with/described in the Standard Personal Information Banks Employee Personnel Record - PSE 901 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse901) and Occupational Health and Safety - PSE 907 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse907). Information may also be used or disclosed for program evaluation and reporting purposes.
