Description: The records containing the information described in this bank include personal information on employees such as education, work history and career aspirations, and training and development, which is collected by means of questionnaires and/or interviews or compiled from employees&#8217; files or automated data systems. The information is collected on a voluntary basis, and respondents are asked to identify whether they are male or female, whether they are an aboriginal person, and whether they have a disability or are a member of a visible minority group. The Personal Record Identifier may be used to identify employees in instances where government institutions are not able to employ an anonymous questionnaire, as well as when these identifiers are required to locate employee records.

Class of Individuals: Employees of the institution.

Purpose: Related records provide documentation for the implementation of the employment equity policy in government institutions. Data are collected to provide a comprehensive picture of employees by sex and by target group status (e.g., women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minority groups). This information is used to compile a personnel profile of employees and to compare the situation of target group members with non-target group members within a government institution and with their counterparts in the general labour market. The Personal Record Identifier (PRI) may be used to link information in this bank with that in another bank containing employee information (e.g., the Personnel Management Information System) in order to obtain statistical information, where the securing of such information would be consistent with the uses for which the personal information was collected. Self-identification information may be obtained from the institutional records as described in the Standard Personal Information Bank Staffing - PSE 902 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse902).

Consistent Uses: The government institution may collect data for statistical purposes, for purposes relating to individuals, or for both. Personal data are released to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for statistical purposes only (refer to Central Personal Information Bank Employment Equity Data Bank - TBS PCE 739 (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/atipo-baiprp/sfg-srg/sfg-srg02-eng.asp)). The information gathered will be used for institutional purposes in the government&#8217;s employment equity program to identify and eliminate systemic discrimination in employment and to introduce temporary special measures to ensure that target groups participate in and are equitably represented in the federal public service. It may also be used for policy and planning purposes related to employment equity.

Retention and Disposal Standards: For information about the length of time that specific types of common administrative records are maintained by a government institution, including the final disposition of those records, please contact the institution&#8217;s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator.
