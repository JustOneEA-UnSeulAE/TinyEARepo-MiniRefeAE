Description: This bank describes information that is collected to support Governor in Council appointments to government institutions. The personal information collected may include: the individual&#8217;s full name, contact information, official language of choice, date of birth, country of birth, citizenship, gender, marital status, Social Insurance Number (SIN), unique identification number (e.g., unique employee number), terms and conditions of appointment including remuneration (e.g., salary, honoraria, per diem rate) and benefits, signature, physical limitations and any other relevant medical information, photographs or other image recordings, educational background, employment status, work history, professional affiliations, credit card and financial institution information, government security clearances, biographical information (including information about family members), conflict of interest declarations, appointment date and duration and resignation dates, if applicable.

Class of Individuals: Current and former appointees and their family members.

Purpose: The personal information collected is used to support the identification and selection of individuals to serve as Governor in Council appointments which include Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of Crown Corporations, Heads of Agencies, and Boards of Governors. Successful individuals are named through an Order in Council - a process that is managed by the Privy Council Office. The personal information is also used to manage the administration of expenses (e.g., travel) and compensation and benefits packages, conduct performance evaluations, maintain an inventory of current and former appointees, record potential conflicts of interest and any compliance action required, and to communicate with these individuals.

Consistent Uses: Personal information about the appointee is contained in the Order in Council document which includes full name, contact information, the position to which s/he is being appointed, the length and tenure of the appointment, and the terms and conditions of the appointment (e.g., remuneration, benefits, vacation leave, etc.). This information is provided by the Privy Council Office to the institution (refer to Governor in Council Personnel Records - PCO PPU 020 (http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications&amp;doc=info-source/index-eng.htm)). Governor in Council Personnel Records - PCO PPU 020). Additionally, this information may be used in the preparation of reports for senior management and broader audiences (e.g., Annual Reports) and communications materials (e.g., press releases, biographies, etc.) that may be disseminated in multiple formats, including the institution&#8217;s website. In some instances, the Privy Council Office receives notes and performance ratings to support the conduct of performance evaluations of selected individuals (refer to Governor in Council Personnel Records - PCO PPU 020 (http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications&amp;doc=info-source/index-eng.htm)). The Social Insurance Number (SIN) is collected pursuant to the Income Tax Act (refer to Individual Returns and Payment Processing &#8211; CRA PPU 005 (http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/tp/nfsrc/nfsrc-eng.html)) and, where applicable, the Province of Quebec Income Tax Act.

Retention and Disposal Standards: For information about the length of time that specific types of common administrative records are maintained by a government institution, including the final disposition of those records, please contact the institution&#8217;s Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator.
