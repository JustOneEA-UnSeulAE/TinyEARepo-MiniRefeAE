Responsible AI adoption needs clear, up-to-date legislation and policy. Together, they mark out not only the necessary guardrails for identifying and mitigating risk, but also the space within which developers are free to experiment and innovate. Clear legislation and policy help to build public trust, overcome institutional resistance to AI innovation and enable governments to move further and faster.

As in many jurisdictions, some Canadian legislation and federal policy has not been revised for the AI era. Some law or policy is silent on areas needed to govern AI, while others may introduce unintended bias in data collection or obstruct AI adoption unnecessarily and unintentionally. Incremental development has created a patchwork of policies that are difficult for AI project teams to understand and navigate, and no common model for AI governance yet exists within the Government of Canada. These challenges must be addressed to build public confidence in the Government of Canada&#8217;s ability to deliver AI-enabled services.

Learn more about: AI-ready law and policy
Policy, law, and regulations must support the use of AI and must be kept updated to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as technology evolves.  In response, the Government of Canada and leading jurisdictions worldwide have begun to incorporate commitments to scheduled review cycles into key laws and policy instruments, a new best practice that should be more widely adopted.

The Government of Canada&#8217;s Directive on Automated Decision-Making and associated Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool are reviewed every two years. 
Amendments made in 2019 to the Access to Information Act include a 5-year review cycle.
The EU AI Act includes provisions for an annual review of both its list of high-risk AI systems and the AI practices it prohibits.
Even without a specified review cycle, other jurisdictions regularly review and amend key legislation and policy:

Australia has conducted regular reviews of its Privacy Act 1988 to address emerging privacy issues and technological developments, with four major reviews since its enactment.
The EU regularly reviews its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other technology-related laws to adapt to new technological advancements and challenges.
Lastly, some jurisdictions have developed guidance to ensure that all new legislation supports new technologies by design.

Denmark&#8217;s digital-ready legislation program has established mandatory assessment against seven principles for digitally-ready legislation to ensure that new laws and regulations are compatible with digital technologies and can be efficiently administered using digital tools.
Key actions
Establish common AI governance and risk management frameworks
Drawing on international and Government of Canada best practice, the Government of Canada will establish common governance and risk management frameworks for the AI lifecycle to provide clear guidance to AI project teams. These frameworks will balance risk with the pace required for innovation; be scaled to system risk, sensitivity, and impact; and will be designed to adapt as technology changes. They will address potential risks associated with AI use, such as data privacy and security, bias detection and mitigation, model interpretability and explainability, environmental impact, and human involvement. The frameworks will incorporate Canadian requirements, such as the need to advance Indigenous Data Sovereignty and provide technologies in both official languages. They will also lay out the security, trust, and reliability controls necessary to ensure the continued maintenance and resilience of these systems, including system shutdown measures to respond to emergencies. This work will support ongoing efforts to harmonize data standards, increase interoperability, and support other enablers.

In addition, it will include a government-wide governance structure responsible for implementing the governance framework. This will include an AI ethics review board responsible for providing guidance on responsible AI and for evaluating higher risk and impact projects at key stages of the project lifecycle. The governance structure will make use of existing Government of Canada governance bodies and organizations such as the Canada AI Safety Institute wherever possible. In addition to providing project governance, these bodies and organizations will help identify high-value AI use cases, regularly reprioritize the AI Strategy's actions, and prioritize and oversee the AI Strategy's implementation.

Address policy and legislative alignment, gaps, and barriers
The Government of Canada will review and propose changes to instruments that create unnecessary obstacles to AI adoption. It will fill identified policy gaps, such as clarifying the responsibilities of chief information, data and privacy officers for AI adoption, and the acceptable use of AI by outside organizations in their interactions with the Government of Canada. It will also address legal and policy ambiguities related to privacy and training data and the application of the national security exemption. The Government of Canada will update procurement policies, instruments and processes to make them more responsive to pace and requirements of AI procurement. It will also consider ways in which the Government of Canada can better align internal AI policy with the Pan Canadian AI Strategy to support the Canadian AI sector, with the United Nations Declaration Act commitments to Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and with international treaties, legislation and norms.

This work will lead to the development of clear and concrete commitments to revise specific instruments within a set timeline, and an agile process to review and update policy, guidance, tools and resources to respond to technological, legislative and social change. The Government of Canada will also review the policy landscape for opportunities to synthesize or interpret existing policy to increase usability.

Adopt a &#8220;think AI&#8221; approach
The Government of Canada will optimize its AI adoption by embedding a &#8220;think AI&#8221; approach to its policies, programs and services. The intent is not to adopt AI at all costs or in contexts where its use would not be responsible or useful. Rather, the goal is to challenge departments to identify key business problems that could be transformed using AI, consider AI options before defaulting to traditional IT or HR approaches, and make planned investments in AI and its enablers.

To support this, the Government of Canada will require departments to:

Identify three areas, programs or services with business problems that have a high potential to be solved using AI.
Consider solutions and resourcing requirements for AI and its enablers at the outset of initiatives. This will include changes to Treasury Board submissions, Memoranda to Cabinet, and budget and off-cycle funding proposals to incorporate data, AI, compute, and other relevant requirements.
Prioritize AI infrastructure and secure adoption in departmental integrated IT planning processes.
Develop their own AI strategies to ensure alignment and effective use of resources.</div>
