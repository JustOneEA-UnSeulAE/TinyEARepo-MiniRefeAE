      <documentation>In order to encourage a culture of &quot;Working in the Open&quot;, and the sharing of software development projects, ESDC is developing an Open Source Software (OSS) Management Framework to guide employees. To this effect, the IT Strategy and IT Research team within ESDC has begun working in the open. Existing project teams are increasingly looking to share their source codes and work in the open (e.g. CDO, CAWS). More than 50 GitHub source code repositories have been shared (32 Developer Experience, 11 Developer Community of Practice [DevCoP] and 9 Service Canada). The DevCoP has numerous repositories on GcCode and GitHub, indicating ESDC’s efforts to both promote and align with the DOSP - working in the open, collaborating widely, using open standards and solutions. Over 99% of EI applications are currently submitted through digital methods. In addition, the Pensions projects (especially CPP-SIS) are further advancing the availability of e-services for that client segment as well.</documentation>

      <documentation>In order to guide and shape how government information, technology and service delivery will be managed in a new digital ecosystem, ESDC is undertaking the following initiatives:&#xD;
   CSLP – E-Service Re-Procurement;&#xD;
   Temporary Foreign Worker System and Webservice Enhancements 2.0; and,&#xD;
   CSLP - New Brunswick SIN Validation. &#xD;
&#xD;
These initiatives will help build a set of digital standards into policy, operations and program development.&#xD;
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ESDC created and rapidly deployed the e-service and eSIN applications. Currently, over 99% of EI applications are currently submitted through digital methods. Additionally, Pensions projects, such as CPP-SIS, are further advancing the availability of e-services for that client segment.</documentation>

      <documentation>TB’s Policy on Service and Digital is estimated to have 247 requirements applying to the departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) function. Along with this are key changes, which produce new expectations for Deputy Heads in the areas of service, information and data, technology, cyber security, as well as workforce capacity and capability. To comply with the Policy, a methodological gap analysis was performed by IITB teams to determine the policy-driven requirements based on five themes: &#xD;
 Governance, planning and reporting (as it relates to IT governance and planning within ESDC);&#xD;
 Service Design and Delivery;&#xD;
 Information and Data;&#xD;
 Technology (including automated decision making); and,&#xD;
 Cyber Security and Identity.&#xD;
The gap analysis looked at IITB’s existing investments and priorities and made 12 recommendations for IITB to either create new initiatives or reprioritize its portfolio of activities. Most of these recommendations are already in progress as part of the IITB Way Forward. The top five prioritized recommendations are:&#xD;
 Clarify the role and responsibilities between the CDO and the CIO;&#xD;
 Establish the role of a designated official for Cyber Security (DOCS);&#xD;
 Review IM/IT and Identity Policies to address redundancy, conflicts, user-centered policy writing, and training;&#xD;
 Harmonize the different service inventories for a single source of truth; and,&#xD;
 Formalize automated decision-making governance at ESDC.&#xD;
These recommendations reflect the integrated management of functions as expected by the Policy, the increased responsibilities of the CIO, and the unique governance entities within ESDC (e.g. use of a CDO, a Chief Security Officer outside the branch of the CIO, and a tier 2 level committee focused on purely on service). &#xD;
In addition, the Branches within the Department have been collaborating internally to improve service delivery and digital transformation:&#xD;
 Business Architecture and Alignment Office participates regularly at EA activities as one of the EA domains in developing project architectures; &#xD;
 User Experience Team provides UX research and design services to IT project teams regularly; and,&#xD;
 Business Process Management Team provides guidance and services on business process mapping to IT project teams regularly.</documentation>

      <documentation>In support of ESDC’s Accessibility Strategy, ESDC is working on and testing an interdepartmental initiative to replace existing GC tools to ensure availability of more accessible toolsets, where such collaborative tools (i.e. Office 365) used for accessibility follow internationally recognized accessibility standards. ESDC is also working to ensure interoperability of adaptive technologies with the ESDC collaboration toolset. These digital collaboration tools are required for Canadians with disabilities as they continue to face barriers to their full participation in the workplace, which limit their opportunities for career development and advancement.</documentation>

      <documentation>Via the Infrastructure Re-use Branch Initiative, connectivity between the legacy ESDC infrastructure and data centres to the SSC End State data centres is being made available as a selfprovisioning service to allow the migration of certain applications. Further work, resources and funds under the WLM Project will need to be engaged to migrate specific ESDC workloads of the legacy data centres to SSC End State data centres.&#xD;
In order to complete the migration of the specific ESDC workloads of the legacy data centres to SSC’s End State data centre, the following projects are being migrated as part of the WLM project: &#xD;
 1-800 O-Canada Business Model Review and Contract ReProcurement; &#xD;
 Emergency Management Application System; &#xD;
 ESDC’s Cloud Implementation Plan is underway to support the departmental application strategy, data centre consolidation and cloud adoption. This includes the Cloud Assessment Framework, Research and Prototyping, and the Cloud Intake process; and,&#xD;

Through its implementation, the Department aims to provide people with easy, secure, and authorized access to quality data in a way that protects privacy and delivers value for Canadians. &#xD;
The Strategy is built on six foundations for improved client service and policy: access, analytics, data governance and stewardship, data management, enablement, and people.&#xD;
Foundations investments include among others:&#xD;
 Master data management (MDM) expansion; &#xD;
 Purchase and installation of ESDC Data Catalogue;&#xD;
 Procurement of SAS (VA);&#xD;
 Data Visualization for Business Solutions; and,&#xD;

CYBERSECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE CLOUD&#xD;
Federal government must strengthen its use of controls to prevent, detect, and respond to threats on personal information stored in the cloud&#xD;
Report 7 | Reports of the Auditor General of Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
At a Glance&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on-premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised. Overall, we found that the requirements the government had in place to reduce the security risks of storing information in the cloud were not always followed by the departments we audited. In addition, these requirements and their corresponding roles and responsibilities were not always clear, resulting in inconsistent implementation and increased risks. This is important because the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has directed departments to consider moving applications and databases to the cloud, so increasing amounts of Canadians’ personal information are moving there. At the same time, cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The risk of significant impacts on the government and its operations is growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The government must take immediate action to strengthen how it prevents, detects, and responds to cyberattacks. It should do this now, while departments are still in the early stages of moving personal information to the cloud. This action includes strengthening key security controls to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches. It also includes clarifying shared roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity—which are highly complex in a cloud environment—so that all departments know exactly what they should be doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We also found that, 4 years after the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat first directed departments to consider moving to the cloud, it had still not provided a long-term funding approach for cloud adoption. It had also not given departments tools to calculate the costs of moving to or of operating in the cloud and securing the information stored in it. Departments need both a funding approach and costing tools to ensure that the people, expertise, skills, training, funding, and other resources they need to secure cloud-based information are available to prevent and address the greatest threats and risks. A funding approach and costing tools are essential for cloud adoption and would strengthen Canada’s cyber-defence capabilities both at the departmental level and government-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
   Why we did this audit&#xD;
&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on‑premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised.&#xD;
Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians’ personal information. Departments must work together to protect this information from a number of risks, including cyberattacks.&#xD;
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise, and strong controls to prevent, detect, and respond to them can reduce the risk of breaches.&#xD;
   Our findings&#xD;
&#xD;
There were weaknesses in departments’ controls for preventing, detecting, and responding to cyberattacks.&#xD;
The roles and responsibilities for ensuring cloud cybersecurity were unclear and incomplete.&#xD;
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat did not provide departments with a costing model or funding approach for cloud services.&#xD;
Public Services and Procurement Canada and Shared Services Canada did not include environmental criteria in their procurement of cloud services.&#xD;
   Key facts and figures&#xD;
&#xD;
Departmental spending on cloud services government-wide has increased significantly year over year, from $35 million in 2018 to almost $120 million in 2021.&#xD;
Digital technologies are expected to be responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and for up to 14% by 2040.&#xD;
The 3 departments we selected for this audit were using a variety of short-term funding measures to support their cloud and cybersecurity operations, including reallocating funds that had been intended for other purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
   Highlights of our recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
In consultation with Shared Services Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should clarify who is responsible for the initial validation and ongoing monitoring of cloud guardrail controls.&#xD;
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should ensure that the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan applies to the evolving cloud environment and shared responsibilities, review and test it at least annually, and update it as needed.&#xD;
In consultation with Shared Services Canada and other departments, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should develop and provide a costing model to help departments make informed decisions about moving to the cloud and Help departments determine their long-term operational funding needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Towards a New Disability Benefit&#xD;
Since 2015, the government has taken steps towards building an inclusive and resilient economy that supports people with disabilities. In addition to enacting groundbreaking legislation to create a barrier-free Canada, the government has also taken concrete steps to help people with disabilities receive enhanced programming and access to benefits, savings plans, and education funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
The pandemic has exposed many of the long-standing challenges persons with disabilities face, including an increased risk of poverty. The Government of Canada has a number of programs and services in place that provide support to Canadians with disabilities but these are often complex and can be difficult to navigate for users. To ensure all persons with disabilities have the support they need to overcome persistent barriers to full economic and social participation, the government is committed to bringing forward a new disability benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2021 proposes to provide $11.9 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to Employment and Social Development Canada to undertake consultations to reform the eligibility process for federal disability programs and benefits. This will help maximize the reach of these programs and improve the lives of Canadians living with disabilities. This work would feed directly into the design of a new disability benefit.&#xD;
In preparation for legislation, the government will undertake extensive consultations with stakeholders on the design of the new benefit and engage with provinces and territories, which play a central role in providing support to many Canadians with disabilities. Employment and Social Development Canada will also establish a steering committee to oversee the development of this work, alongside the Canada Revenue Agency, the Department of Finance Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada.</documentation>

      <documentation>Advancing Inclusion of Canadians with Disabilities&#xD;
In October 2022, the government launched the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to disability inclusion. Community engagement is a key aspect—the government needs to get views from Canadians with disabilities in matters that affect them. To further enhance disability inclusion in Canada:&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes to provide $10 million over two years, beginning in 2023-24, to Employment and Social Development Canada to help address the unique needs and ongoing barriers faced by persons with disabilities by investing in capacity building and the community-level work of Canada's disability organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes to provide $21.5 million in 2023-24 to Employment and Social Development Canada to continue work on the future delivery of the Canada Disability Benefit, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process.&#xD;
&#xD;
The government remains committed to the launch of a Canada Disability Benefit as part of the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process. Investments in Budget 2023 continue to lay the necessary groundwork for the Canada Disability Benefit, building off of the government's reintroduction of the Canada Disability Benefit Act in June 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting Canadians With Disabilities&#xD;
The federal government provides significant support to Canadians with disabilities. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
More than $1.6 billion per year to support persons with severe and prolonged mental and physical impairments through the Disability Tax Credit;&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $1 billion per year through Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds, as well as exempting from tax investment income earned in Registered Disability Savings Plans, which supports the financial security of persons with disabilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
Providing $922 million to provinces and territories through the Workforce Development Agreements in 2023-24, approximately 30 per cent of which is targeted to help persons with disabilities get training, develop their skills, and gain work experience;&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $650 million annually through more generous Canada Student Grants, interest-free Canada Student Loans, and easier-to-access repayment assistance—including loan forgiveness for those with severe permanent disabilities—to support persons with disabilities with the additional costs of post-secondary education, such as those that come with supportive services and devices;&#xD;
&#xD;
$105 million in 2023-24 to support the implementation of an employment strategy for persons with disabilities through the Opportunities Fund. This included funding to the Ready, Willing and Able Program to support persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder or intellectual disabilities in finding employment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $460 million per year through the Child Disability Benefit provided as a supplement to the Canada Child Benefit for parents of children with severe and prolonged disabilities, providing an average of approximately $2,700 in annual support.&#xD;
&#xD;
Along with the proposed Canada Disability Benefit Act, these measures form part of the government's Disability Inclusion Action Plan, which aims to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities.</documentation>

It’s time to build a future that makes Canada strong. We can give ourselves much more than any foreign government, including the United States, can ever take away. Building one Canadian economy, for example, can expand our economy by up to $200 billion — proof that we are strongest when we are united. Elbows up.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Globe and Mail&#xD;
Published: 2025-05-27&#xD;
A Throne Speech fit for a king. But where's the budget?&#xD;
The federal government still has time to fix this and produce a spring budget&#xD;
&#xD;
Colin Busby, Nicholas Dahir and William Robson&#xD;
Colin Busby is director, policy engagement, of the C.D. Howe Institute, where Nicholas Dahir is a research officer and William Robson is president and CEO.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Speech from the Throne delivered by King Charles III on Tuesday will be remembered as an anomaly, and not just because of the speaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here's how it usually goes: A Throne Speech opens a legislative session, laying out the government's priorities. Then, at the start of that legislative session, the government presents a budget to provide key fiscal context for its priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The annual budget is the cornerstone of the government's financial and economic management. It provides the big picture within which specific choices - notably the spending MPs must approve in the estimates - should fit. Without a budget, Canadians cannot properly assess the legislative priorities, including the cuts to personal income taxes and the GST specifically mentioned in the Throne Speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the government, instead of committing to delivering a budget at the start of the legislative session, has delayed it until the fall. The budget could be up to half a year away. It is highly unusual for a Throne Speech to not be followed by a budget for so long.&#xD;
&#xD;
It does not have to be this way. Or, at least, the government still has time to fix it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ottawa had previously decided to not even present a budget this year. The federal government's turnabout to deliver a 2025 budget is good news - but not good enough. While better than no budget at all, a budget so late in the year is an affront to fiscal accountability, and a snub to parliamentarians and the Canadians who elected them. The message the government now needs to hear is that a spring budget is still possible, and that it should deliver one.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budgets tell MPs and Canadians how much money the government plans to raise and how the government will raise it. They say how much the government will spend, and how the government will spend it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The federal fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. Governments ideally present budgets in January or February, well before the fiscal year has started. Presenting after the fiscal year has begun means that the government is already raising and spending without proper scrutiny. But presenting a budget while the House of Commons is sitting - prior to June 20 - would be far better than waiting until the fall when the fiscal numbers will be less plan than fait accompli.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is almost half a year since the 2024 fall economic statement. With the new government moving to implement the tax and spending promises from the election campaign and Throne Speech, Parliament and the public need an up-to-date fiscal plan before billions of dollars in new measures are rolled out. &#xD;
&#xD;
Canada's fraught economic situation - chronic low investment and productivity growth, geopolitical risks, and a protracted trade war with the United States - makes a spring budget all the more desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
U.S. fiscal profligacy is pushing interest rates up internationally. An information vacuum that adds to uncertainty about Canadian finances helps no one and will raise alarm among the country's credit rating agencies, which have recently downgraded the scores of two large provinces - Quebec and British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
A late budget would also exacerbate a worrying trend. In the past three decades, the federal government has tabled budgets after the start of the fiscal year only five times. Four of those late budgets appeared since 2015. In 2020, for the first time ever, the federal government failed to produce a budget at all. Defenders of this sidelining of legislative oversight often point out that Parliament must still approve the estimates - the documents that outline a detailed spending plan, which require specific legislative approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the dominance of statutory programs such as seniors' benefits, federal-provincial transfers and interest on Ottawa's growing debt in federal expenses means the estimates cover a relatively small share of the budget. And when the relevant parliamentary committees fail to review their estimates by a May 31 deadline - as happened in the case of 10 committees charged with reviewing $25-billion in federal outlays in 2024 - the estimates are deemed approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
To those who say the recent federal election is an excuse for a late budget, we have a straightforward reply. It is not. If the previous government had taken timeliness more seriously, we would have had a budget before the election.&#xD;
The Ontario government, notwithstanding the same fraught environment and its own election, has produced its 2025 budget. The federal election in 2011 occurred on May 2 and that new government produced a budget on June 6. There is no excuse for delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
A fiscal plan produced in a hurry might even be better. Another adverse trend in recent federal budgets has been bloat: hundreds of pages of self-congratulatory spin, condescending narrative and repetition of previous announcements, which buried the key numbers where only experts could find them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Time pressure could give us something short and to the point: projections for revenues, expenses, the bottom line and the resulting change in the debt right up front, where anyone - including parliamentarians and voters - can find and understand them.&#xD;
&#xD;
The spring window is still open. The government has a chance to correct course for the benefit of Parliament and the public. It should take it.&#xD;

Throne Speech promises largest economic transformation since Second World War&#xD;
Robert Fife, Stephanie Levitz&#xD;
In a ceremony marked by pomp and pageantry, King Charles III opened Parliament on Tuesday, delivering a Throne Speech&#xD;
that affirmed Canada's sovereignty and promised the largest transformation in the Canadian economy since the Second&#xD;
World War.&#xD;
The speech, written by Prime Minister Mark Carney's office in consultation with the King's office, touched on Liberal election&#xD;
promises, including a middle-class tax cut, an end to interprovincial trade barriers, and fast approvals of major infrastructure&#xD;
projects. It framed them as part of a generational opportunity to renew and fortify the country at an uncertain time for the world.&#xD;
The message laced through the Throne Speech was that Canada is an independent country, ready to negotiate a trade and&#xD;
security arrangement with the United States but also determined to forge new trade and defence ties with other partners. The&#xD;
King's presence was widely seen as a signal to U.S. President Donald Trump that Canada is unwilling to abandon its distinct&#xD;
heritage and traditions.&#xD;
The King and Queen Camilla arrived at the Senate, a temporary location housed in a converted railway station, in horse-drawn&#xD;
carriage, accompanied by Governor-General Mary Simon and her husband Whit Fraser. The streets were lined with onlookers&#xD;
keen to get a glimpse of the royal couple, and the crowds several times burst into spontaneous eruptions of God Save the King.&#xD;
Mr. Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, invited the King a few days after he won the Liberal&#xD;
Party leadership, as Mr. Trump was talking of turning the country into the 51st state.&#xD;
In a preamble that was written by the King, the monarch spoke about how each time he visits this country, including this 20th&#xD;
trip, &quot;a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream.&quot;&#xD;
&quot;I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada's unique identity, which is recognized across the world,&quot; King Charles&#xD;
said. He also spoke to the importance of the monarchy to Canadian history. &quot;The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity&#xD;
for Canada.&quot;&#xD;
The King mentioned that when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened Parliament in 1957, it was in the aftermath of the&#xD;
Second World War and in the midst of the Cold War. The world faces a different threat with democratic pluralism, the rule of law&#xD;
and freedom under assault, he said.&#xD;
&quot;The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is&#xD;
changing. Canada's relationships with partners is also changing,&quot; he said.&#xD;
The King acknowledged that &quot;many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around&#xD;
them,&quot; but called on the country to look at the U.S. trade war as an opportunity to think bigger and better.&#xD;
&quot;An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War,&quot; he said. &quot;All&#xD;
Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.&quot; He added that &quot;by&#xD;
staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.&quot;&#xD;
Late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump repeated his rhetoric about annexing Canada, claiming the country is &quot;considering&quot; the&#xD;
proposition although it has roundly rejected it.&#xD;
In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump held out what he described as the US$61-billion cost of participating in his proposed missile&#xD;
defence system as a reason for Ottawa to agree to annexation.&#xD;
The Prime Minister's Office would not say whether Mr. Trump had delivered this same message or the cost figure to the&#xD;
government directly.&#xD;
It's rare for Canada's monarch to read the Throne Speech. Usually it is read by the governorgeneral. Queen Elizabeth II, the&#xD;
only other reigning monarch to read the speech, did so twice.&#xD;
The King travelled to Canada specifically to deliver it, but also spent Monday touring parts of Ottawa and planting a tree, and&#xD;
later Tuesday laid a wreath at the National War Memorial, before departing back to Britain.&#xD;
He and Camilla sent words of thanks to Canadians for a successful first trip as sovereign.&#xD;
&quot;It was the warmest of welcomes - and the fondest of returns to a land and a people we love,&quot; the King posted to social media.&#xD;
&quot;Until the next time, au revoir, Canada.&quot;&#xD;
Among the many dignitaries invited to attend the opening of Parliament were former prime ministers Justin Trudeau, Stephen&#xD;
Harper and Kim Campbell and former governors-general Adrienne Clarkson, Michaëlle Jean and David Johnston.&#xD;
The speech also reiterated many of the top-line promises from Mr. Carney's election platform, from speeding up housing&#xD;
construction to toughening border security to cracking down on stolen cars and fentanyl trafficking, and boosting Canada's&#xD;
presence in the High Arctic.&#xD;
The government committed Canada to join the ReArm Europe plan, a major defence procurement project to ramp up military&#xD;
arms production in Europe.&#xD;
The move could reduce Canada's reliance on the United States for purchases of military equipment.&#xD;
In an outreach to Indigenous peoples, the Throne Speech also pledged up to $10-billion in loans to enable more&#xD;
communities to become owners of major projects.&#xD;
In a reflection of Mr. Carney's campaign pledge to move swiftly, within hours of the speech, the government tabled a waysandmeans&#xD;
motion to cut personal income tax, the GST on homes and formally end the consumer price on carbon. The motion&#xD;
is a precursor to eventual legislation.&#xD;
The new government, which won a strong minority mandate of 169 seats, also vowed to reduce federal spending.&#xD;
The opposition parties offered tepid reviews of the remarks, with all three parties saying it sent negative signs about what kind&#xD;
of government Mr. Carney will run.&#xD;
Bloc Québécois Leader YvesFrançois Blanchet said to him, the speech set up Mr. Carney as the &quot;CEO of Canada,&quot; with the&#xD;
provinces just as regional offices.&#xD;
&quot;This is not the way it works,&quot; Mr. Blanchet said.&#xD;
Interim NDP leader Don Davies said some elements of the speech sounded like they could have been written by a&#xD;
Conservative government, with its mentions of defence, crime and a focus on natural resource development. There was no&#xD;
discussion of health care, affordable housing or expanding existing programs such as child care or pharmacare, he said.&#xD;
&quot;That's why New Democrats are going to be, I think, such an important voice in Parliament to be pushing for progressive&#xD;
policies,&quot; he said.&#xD;
Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told reporters he'd have written a different speech, one that laid out far more specifics.&#xD;
&quot;Let's replace the talking points with real plans to get it done,&quot; he said.&#xD;
Mr. Poilievre, whose party was on track to win the recent election until taking on Mr. Trump became the ballot-box question,&#xD;
also acknowledged the meaning of having the King deliver the speech.&#xD;
&quot;I think it's important that the world recognize that we have those ancient traditions, that the Americans recognize that we are&#xD;
an independent and free country, that will make its own decisions.&quot;&#xD;

The Throne Speech shows bold vision – but success requires strong public services&#xD;
Prime Minister Mark Carney has set an ambitious agenda to protect Canada, and we welcome it. His government is facing new and unprecedented challenges: economic uncertainty, global instability, trade disruptions, and threats to Canadian sovereignty. As King Charles III noted in the historic Speech from the Throne, &quot;the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
The scale of the government's ambitions is impressive. From building the strongest economy in the G7 to doubling the rate of home construction, from eliminating internal trade barriers by Canada Day to cutting project approval times from 5 years to 2 – this is the kind of bold leadership Canada needs right now.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ambition without capacity is just talk&#xD;
But here's the reality: you can't deliver on more goals with fewer tools. The Throne Speech promises transformational change while simultaneously pledging to cap the public service and cut operating budgets. This contradiction undermines the government's own agenda.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a stronger, more resilient Canada means investing in the public service to succeed. Our members are the quiet force behind Canada's strength – dedicated professionals who protect the health, safety, and economic security of Canadians by building the systems we all rely on when times get tough.&#xD;
&#xD;
Take the Major Federal Project Office, which will cut approval times in half while &quot;upholding Canada's world-leading environmental standards.&quot; Who will staff these accelerated reviews? Scientists, engineers, policy analysts, and regulatory experts – the very public servants whose numbers the government plans to cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
Public services: Canada's anchor in uncertain times&#xD;
In a volatile world, the public service is Canada’s stabilizer. They are the engine behind our economy, our infrastructure, and our national security. They provide safety nets, protect public health, and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Throne Speech acknowledges that &quot;many Canadians are struggling to get ahead&quot; and promises help through programs like the Canadian Dental Care Plan, Pharmacare, and child care. But these programs don't run themselves – they require skilled public servants to design, deliver, and improve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
You cannot protect Canadians by weakening the institutions they rely on.&#xD;
&#xD;
We've been here before – and we delivered&#xD;
PIPSC members have a long history of stepping up in times of crisis. During COVID-19, our members were:&#xD;
&#xD;
Designing and delivering emergency benefit programs that kept families afloat&#xD;
Working in labs to develop mass COVID testing methods&#xD;
Keeping government systems running so Canadians could access support&#xD;
Training nurses to manage outbreaks and bringing Canadians home from abroad&#xD;
Our expertise didn't just help manage the crisis – it helped lead the recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
This moment is no different. Whether it's implementing the new border security measures outlined in the Speech, supporting the creation of Build Canada Homes, or helping deliver on the promise to remove internal trade barriers, our members will be there.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ready to partner for Canada's success&#xD;
We're not just raising concerns – we're offering partnership. PIPSC members are ready to do their part to deliver on this ambitious agenda, just as we always have.&#xD;
&#xD;
But that requires investment in people and services – not cuts, caps, or constraints. Prime Minister Carney's expanded cabinet shows the government understands the scope of the work ahead. Now they need to ensure the public service has the capacity to match that ambition.&#xD;
&#xD;
We're here for Canada. Built to serve, ready to protect.&#xD;
The question is: will the government give us the tools we need to deliver the Canada they've promised?&#xD;

&#xD;
PROBLEM STATEMENT&#xD;
Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada must successfully complete an open, fair, and transparent competitive procurement process to secure a new contract for Social Media Management Services (SMMS). To prevent any disruption in SMMS for 78 GC institutions, the new contract must be secured by spring-summer 2026. The new contract will ensure that all 78 GC institutions maintain existing SMMS capabilities for their daily communications operations and to meet the information needs of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
The current multi-departmental software-as-a-service contract for the Government of Canada (GC) SMMS ends on March 14, 2027. Initially awarded in 2014 and extended twice, the contract will reach its lifecycle end in 2027 and must be re-competed. There is no possibility to extend the contract further. Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada (ESDC/SC) is the technical and project authority for this contract.&#xD;
&#xD;
By virtue of Order in Council (OiC) P.C. 2014-0349 and the ESDC Act, ESDC/SC is mandated to administer the SMMS that enable GC institutions to manage their official social media (SM) accounts. </documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Undergo An RFP Process" id="id-79158ea2b78c40a4acdd1792c2d58157">
      <documentation>This proposal aims to start the procurement activities needed to re-compete the SMMS contract, including posting a request for proposals (RFP).&#xD;
The objective is to give all companies a fair opportunity to provide the SMMS offering and ensure the new contract is awarded in 2026.&#xD;
In going back to market to compete the SMMS contract through a fair, competitive process, ESDC/SC aims to:&#xD;
• maintain SMMS that enable GC departments to publish, schedule, gather analytics, and monitor topics of interest on social media content&#xD;
• support federal institutions in meeting departmental communications objectives and the information needs of Canadians&#xD;
• meet legislative requirements</documentation>

      <documentation>KEY ACTIVITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
Work under the Data Innovation Service Area is comprised of various projects through which CDOB partners with business leads to explore opportunities and address business needs. These projects help the Department achieve better value and improve service to Canadians. &#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing demand for services means we need to increase efficiency. Real life examples include finding $192M in unclaimed benefits by linking information across the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. Through this initiative, ESDC addressed the challenge of children of disabled or deceased CPP contributors being unaware of or facing barriers in accessing the Children’s Benefit. A decade of CPP administrative data was linked to Canada Student Loans administrative data to find and list former beneficiaries who were eligible for continued CPP benefits but were not receiving them. On average 9,700 cases of eligible non-recipients were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
Using natural language processing, the Record of Employment (ROE) AI model helped reduce the workload for the Employment Insurance program by automatically categorizing a portion of simple comments on ROEs. The model helped automatically process over half a million comments, speeding up benefit delivery for Canadians. Similarly, over 350,000 T4 work items for CPP and Old Age Security (OAS) recipients were closed between 2017 and 2021, enabling client service officers to shift their focus to more complex cases. &#xD;
Optical character recognition and intelligent document processing are also being evaluated and deployed to help ESDC programs enhance form processing in the Department. This work is another example of work that is helping reduce wait times and allowing agents to focus on more complex work.&#xD;
&#xD;
These are just a few examples of how work in the data innovation space is propelling ESDC forward. Work under this Service Area is helping us use data in innovative ways that improve our understanding of our clients' needs and how we serve them. At the same time, it helps us better understand and manage the potential and risks of new technologies and methods.</documentation>

It is a first step towards ensuring that data responsibilities are communicated and well understood across the Department. The Data Accountability Framework lists specific accountabilities and decision rights for managing data assets across key organizational leadership roles. Defining clear accountabilities within ESDC’s governance structure supports timely decision making and effective data management, as well as assessment and management of key risks and issues. Developed in line with various departmental and Government of Canada policies, legislation, and guidance, it organizes data management accountabilities into 14 distinct categories, including Artificial Intelligence, Data/Information Architecture, and Privacy. The Accountability Framework was endorsed by the ESDC Enterprise Management Committee on October 19, 2023.</documentation>

Every data steward across the Department is responsible for content within the Data Inventory. The Inventory then feeds into the highlevel, outward facing Enterprise Data Catalogue platform. ESDC’s Enterprise Data Inventory 2.0 will enable PARE analysts, service officers, and managers to efficiently access information on ESDC’s data holdings all in one place. This includes providing a Data Steward contact name for the person in the Department responsible for each dataset. Analysts can search data by descriptive metadata, such as keyword, to find datasets that could be of use in their assigned projects. </documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Data Sharing Framework: Modernize Data Sharing Practices" id="id-bd6f66185f8a465aa5f732ce5c90696e">
      <documentation>ESDC is also modernizing its current data sharing practices by developing an enterprise-wide data and information sharing framework. The framework is being developed through collaboration with ESDC branches, all levels of government and Indigenous partners. Current data and information sharing practices between ESDC and its partners could be more efficient and transparent. Better practices would increase ESDC’s ability to deliver client-centred services as departmental and interdepartmental data are incrementally centralized, catalogued and integrated while continuing to respect ‘need to know’ principles, confidentiality protocols, and policy and legislative requirements. This will help to minimize costs and risks while increasing efficiencies. An enterprise information sharing framework will standardize and enhance data sharing across the Government of Canada, with the goal of improving data quality and consistency, strengthening data stewardship, increasing data-driven insights, and embedding collaboration with other government departments as the standard, while adhering to legal requirements.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Resource" name="GC Enterprise Architecture Framework - Business Architecture Guide" id="id-460c61e600f64aff9faa96328efe4e9a">
      <documentation>Business Architecture&#xD;
&#xD;
Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.&#xD;
Design services digitally from end‑to‑end to meet the Government of Canada users and other stakeholders’ needs&#xD;
Clearly identify internal and external users and other stakeholders and their needs for each policy, program and business service&#xD;
In order to ensure that a service will be able to meet the users and stakeholders' needs, it needs to understand what needs it is trying to provide service for, who their users and stakeholders are, both internal and external.&#xD;
Once the needs, the users and stakeholders are defined, then a service provider can proceed to create a stakeholder mapping to further understand the relationship between the service and the users &amp; stakeholders, ie. how a change in one component impacts the other.&#xD;
From there, the service provider can conduct need analysis of its users and stakeholder to develop a program, a policy or a service that meets their needs (this practice may also be known as stakeholder requirements or value mapping).&#xD;
This exercise can also help define the limitation/scope of the program/policy/service to better manage the expectation of their users/stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * summarize the needs and outcome of each key external and internal stakeholders in scope of the architecture&#xD;
    * demonstrate how the architecture is focused on the needs and outcomes of internal and external stakeholders&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Business Case&#xD;
    * Stakeholder (Actors, Roles, Organizational Units) Mapping &amp; Stakeholder requirements &#xD;
    * Outcomes&#xD;
    * Business Process Map&#xD;
    * Value Stream and Value Mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
include policy requirement applying to specific users and other stakeholder groups, such as accessibility, gender-based plus analysis, and official languages in the creation of the service&#xD;
To ensure that a service can be used by all its users, it is important to note the specific requirements for specific users and to that extent, it is important to take note and apply the policy that governs the service standards when providing service to the specific user groups.&#xD;
This will in turn enable the service to be far-reaching and more inclusive to all its users.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline what policies constrain the architecture&#xD;
    * Outline positive and negative impact the policy has on the architecture to meet the needs of the stakeholder&#xD;
    * Outline how architecture supports full spectrum of service design and user experience&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * User Interface Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
perform Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) to support risk mitigation activities when deploying an automated decision system as per Directive on Automated Decision-Making&#xD;
When a service has an in-system developed automation for decision making, it is essential that the service perform AIA, to ensure that the result of this decision making is impartial and fair, and the impact of that decision would be the same as if the decision is made manually, only faster.&#xD;
The use of this type of system must closely follow the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Provide the impact level based on the completion of the conceptual AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture will address the recommendations coming from the AIA&#xD;
    * Describe how the architecture meets the directive's requirements for the impact level&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * AIA Results (Conceptual)&#xD;

Model end-to-end business service delivery to provide quality, maximize effectiveness and optimize efficiencies across all channels (for example, lean process)&#xD;
When creating a service, make sure the service delivery is modeled end-to-end to make sure the intended end users can actually reap the benefit of the service being offered.&#xD;
Go through the business process map step-by-step to ensure all points/nodes within the process behaves expectedly resulting in an intended outcome.&#xD;
Ensure all points/nodes within the process is optimized.&#xD;
Create all possible positive and negative scenarios that can possibly occur.&#xD;
Then go through different possible scenarios to ensure the service is still being delivered correctly, effectively and efficiently.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the delivery of value to customer across the architecture’s  business ecosystem  and the contribution of each stakeholder to the value&#xD;

Architect to be outcome‑driven and strategically aligned to the department and to the Government of Canada&#xD;
identify which departmental/GC business services, outcomes and strategies will be addressed&#xD;
To ensure that the Government of Canada provide the best service to its citizen, the services provided needs to be cohesive, ie. the work conducted by each department needs to complement each other to avoid overlap and to ensure continuance of service from one department to another.&#xD;
In order for a service to be meaningful, it needs to be tied into the driver of why the service is required and the outcome expected from a departmental mandate. The service can affect the mandate directly/indirectly, however, one needs to justify the needs of the service in relation to the actual mandate of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the GC/Departmental Strategies the architect aligns and/or implements&#xD;
    * Describe the architecture's contribution to realizing the appropriate outcomes of the strategy&#xD;
   Artifacts:&#xD;
    * Drivers&#xD;
    * Outcomes (intimidate and ultimate)&#xD;
    * Business services (External)&#xD;
&#xD;
establish metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the life cycle of an investment&#xD;
Once we know which outcome that a service is tied into, and whether or not it is directly affecting the outcome expected, we need to be able to justify the effort required to build the service vs. the outcome exerted by the service.&#xD;
We need a way to quantify the impact of this service / establish a metrics for this service.&#xD;
This is an important step to ensure that we can prioritize the effort correctly to identify and build the right service that is of high priority with the budget assigned.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * What are the metrics used to ensure that the outcomes are being realized&#xD;
    * What data is required for the metrics and identify how any gaps in the data will be addressed.&#xD;

translate business outcomes and strategy into business capability implications in the GC Business Capability Model to establish a common vocabulary between business, development, and operation&#xD;
Once we understood the outcomes and strategy to achieve the outcome, we need to translate it into business capability implications. Historically, the Business Capability Model is a common vocabulary between business, development and operation.&#xD;
When the plan conveyed is understood by the development and operation, it would be easier to obtain the system required.&#xD;
Having an open communication between the various teams also helps in getting the right solution that closely match the business requirement.&#xD;

Promote horizontal enablement of the enterprise&#xD;
identify opportunities to enable business services horizontally across the GC enterprise and to provide cohesive experience to users and other stakeholders&#xD;
In creating any service, we always need to go back to think about the users/stakeholders. Put ourselves in the users'/stakeholders' shoes. If we are at the receiving end of the service, what kind of experience do we get when we are trying to get the service. Does the user need to know where to get related services, or can we provide them with a seamless service, a cohesive service ? How do we provide a good experience to the users / stakeholders ?&#xD;
We need to start thinking more of an enterprise level, starting at the departmental level first. How can we enable this service across the department ? Is there any opportunity to reuse what we have in other areas of the department ? What do we need to do to leverage this process ?&#xD;
We need to plug in to community of practices, network of expertise or other working groups in order to exchange information, understand the various obstacles experienced by others, get lessons learned from others' experiences, share lessons learned, learn from others how they overcome similar obstacles in their work, share your solutions to others.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Summarize the departmental / GC opportunities where the architecture could be reused&#xD;
    * Summarize departmental/GC architectures that impact or influence the ability of the user having a cohesive experience&#xD;
       (what are the plans to ensure user has a cohesive experience across these architectures and the ecosystem)&#xD;

reuse common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions from across government and private sector&#xD;
If there is a business capabilities, processes or enterprise solution that can be utilized in creating the service, eg. perhaps during the exchange of information from working groups, community of practices, workshops or even from working with private sectors, that are proven to work, we should consider using it prior to inventing our own.&#xD;
This will optimize the time required to build the approach or the solution. Rather than having to proof the concept or solution actually works, use the ones that have a proven record.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Describe the plan and approach to standardize the realization of the business capability so it can be reused within the department and GC&#xD;
   Tools:&#xD;
    * Projects to value Stream Script&#xD;
    * Business Capability Heat map&#xD;
&#xD;
publish in the open all reusable common business capabilities, processes and enterprise solutions for others to develop and leverage cohesive horizontal enterprise services&#xD;
Going back to the previous point on thinking at an enterprise level, one of the ways to enable a service that we build across the GC is by having it published in the open for other departments to see and re-use. Then and only we can create a cohesive horizontal enterprise services to create a cohesive experience to the users / stakeholders.&#xD;
   How to demonstrate that the project fulfils this framework:&#xD;
    * Outline the plan to allow other public sector organizations to reuse the common capability&#xD;

      <documentation>Information Architecture&#xD;
&#xD;
Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.&#xD;

      <documentation>https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html&#xD;
&#xD;
Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice. See also: GC Catalogue.&#xD;
&#xD;
Design with users&#xD;
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Work in the open by default&#xD;
Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Be good data stewards&#xD;
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Design ethical services&#xD;
Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).&#xD;
&#xD;
Collaborate widely&#xD;
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.</documentation>

Demonstrate a strong commitment to constructive collaboration while taking personal responsibility for the ethical, transparent, and effective use of data.&#xD;
They exist as additional guidelines that complement the GC Policy (https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and Directive on Service and Digital (https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601), and the ESDC Policy on Information and Data Management (https://iservice.prv/eng/imit/ims/clients/departmental-policy.shtml)&#xD;
As such, they are aligned to and do not contravene CDOB’s overarching principles – they are mutually reinforcing to ESDC’s transformation agenda&#xD;

      <documentation>PIPEDA FAQS&#xD;
Is PIPEDA mandatory in Canada?&#xD;
Whether your business is subject to PIPEDA or not depends on the type of business you run and the data it collects. PIPEDA, which stands for Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, is a Canadian federal privacy law that governs how private sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information during commercial activities. So, if your business operates in Canada and collects personal information from customers, employees, or others, it may be subject to PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Is PIPEDA the same as GDPR?&#xD;
PIPEDA is specific to Canada and focuses on protecting personal information in the context of commercial activities. GDPR, on the other hand, has a much broader scope and applies to any business that collects EU citizen data, regardless of location. Both laws aim to protect the privacy rights of individuals and ensure that organizations handle personal data responsibly.&#xD;
&#xD;
Does PIPEDA apply to USA?&#xD;
No, PIPEDA is only for companies with Canada.</documentation>

Data Innovation&#xD;
Data provides us the opportunity to ask and answer key questions about our operations:&#xD;
&#xD;
Who are we helping?&#xD;
How are we helping them?&#xD;
Can we improve this process?&#xD;
Did we have the impact we had hoped for?&#xD;
Who are we leaving behind?&#xD;
Data Innovation is what drives us to find answers to these types of questions and many more. It supports Business Optimization and Analytics for Decision Making. Data Innovation is about finding new ways to answer questions, finding answers to questions we have never been able to answer before, and in finding questions that we have never even thought to ask. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Data Innovation is about helping you use Advanced Research Methods, Artificial Intelligence, and Intelligent Automation to learn more about our clients and ourselves. ESDC’s Chief Data Officer Branch can help you understand and use modern Design and Development, as well as Reporting and Analytics Visualization, to make the best choices you can in your role at ESDC.</documentation>

Data Culture and Literacy&#xD;
Gaining insights and finding answers to complex questions is only part of the journey. It’s up to you to use that knowledge wisely. The importance of strong Data Culture and Literacy cannot be overstated as foundational to unlocking the value, and actualizing the potential, of ESDC’s vast data holdings. &#xD;
&#xD;
Culture and Literacy are about empowering employees and executives to better understand and use our collective data to ensure programs and services meet the evolving needs of our clients and Canadians. It’s about providing the tools, training, and resources needed to understand the role data play in your work, as well as how to fully leverage data as an enterprise asset. &#xD;
&#xD;
It starts with Talent and Capacity Building, whether Hiring top tier talent or Upskilling and Reskilling existing employees. It is vital that leaders across government equip their organizations and teams with the talent and tools necessary to manage their data effectively, and to use ESDC’s vast vaults of data to their fullest potential. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Chief Data Office has been creating, leading, and supporting ESDC’s data communities of practice, as well as awareness and engagement campaigns, to ensure a stronger culture of data users. Having strong partnerships through proper Business Relationship Management across ESDC ensures we can get the right data into the right hands to make the right choices. </documentation>

Data Governance and Trust&#xD;
An important part of data as a Team Effort is ensuring a common understanding of the various roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities that come with the management of any enterprise asset (such as with HR or Finance). It requires proper Governance and Trust to guide the process of getting the right data into the right hands to make the right decision, while maintaining the confidentiality, security, and privacy of personal information.&#xD;

      <documentation>Employment Equity and Diversity&#xD;
&#xD;
Description: The records containing the information described in this bank include personal information on employees such as education, work history and career aspirations, and training and development, which is collected by means of questionnaires and/or interviews or compiled from employees’ files or automated data systems. The information is collected on a voluntary basis, and respondents are asked to identify whether they are male or female, whether they are an aboriginal person, and whether they have a disability or are a member of a visible minority group. The Personal Record Identifier may be used to identify employees in instances where government institutions are not able to employ an anonymous questionnaire, as well as when these identifiers are required to locate employee records.&#xD;
&#xD;
Class of Individuals: Employees of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose: Related records provide documentation for the implementation of the employment equity policy in government institutions. Data are collected to provide a comprehensive picture of employees by sex and by target group status (e.g., women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minority groups). This information is used to compile a personnel profile of employees and to compare the situation of target group members with non-target group members within a government institution and with their counterparts in the general labour market. The Personal Record Identifier (PRI) may be used to link information in this bank with that in another bank containing employee information (e.g., the Personnel Management Information System) in order to obtain statistical information, where the securing of such information would be consistent with the uses for which the personal information was collected. Self-identification information may be obtained from the institutional records as described in the Standard Personal Information Bank Staffing - PSE 902 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse902).&#xD;
&#xD;
Consistent Uses: The government institution may collect data for statistical purposes, for purposes relating to individuals, or for both. Personal data are released to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for statistical purposes only (refer to Central Personal Information Bank Employment Equity Data Bank - TBS PCE 739 (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/atipo-baiprp/sfg-srg/sfg-srg02-eng.asp)). The information gathered will be used for institutional purposes in the government’s employment equity program to identify and eliminate systemic discrimination in employment and to introduce temporary special measures to ensure that target groups participate in and are equitably represented in the federal public service. It may also be used for policy and planning purposes related to employment equity.&#xD;

Dr. Chris Harding founded Lacibus to develop, promote, and exploit a new data platform paradigm, the Virtual Data Lake, following many years as a Forum Director of The Open Group. Virtual data lakes enable applications to mix and match data from different sources, applying distributed access control to ensure the right people have the right data. The core virtual data lake implementation is open source, and incorporates ideas developed by Chris during his work at The Open Group.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Encoding&#xD;
Digital computer data consists of sequences of zeros and ones. A data encoding standard states how data values such as numbers, text strings, and images should be represented as sequences of zeros and ones, and how such a sequence should be parsed to create data values; for example, ISO®/IEC® 10646:2020: Information Technology – Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) (see References) states how text characters are represented as sequences of zeros and ones in various formats, including UTF-8.&#xD;
A list of media types (formerly known as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types) that includes the data decoding standards in common use is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).1 These standards are not listed here. The reader should consult the IANA media type registries.&#xD;
Some data encoding standards also define content display or data structure. The media type standards listed by IANA include content display standards and data structure standards as well as data encoding standards.</documentation>

      <documentation>Content Display&#xD;
A content display standard states how human-readable content should be represented by data values (and therefore, in conjunction with a data encoding standard, as binary zeros and ones).&#xD;
The most common content display conventions are not formally standardized; for example, conventional English text consists of words, sentences, and paragraphs delimited by spaces and punctuation marks.&#xD;
Table 1 contains examples of formal standards that extend these conventions.&#xD;

Spreadsheets&#xD;
A convention is sometimes used in spreadsheets and CSV files that one row (the header row) contains the names of the columns, and the cells beneath it contain the values. When a spreadsheet or CSV file has consistently-typed columns (so that it is like a relational database table) the ISO/IEC 11179 standard could apply to its semantics.</documentation>

      <documentation>Metadata Registries&#xD;
International Standard ISO/IEC 11179-1: 2015: Information Technology – Metadata Registries (MDR) – Part 1: Framework (see References) defines a framework for data semantics that is in practice used in connection with relational databases, but in theory could be applied more widely.&#xD;
In this framework, data encodes information about real-world objects and their properties. A data element is a unit of data that is considered in context to be indivisible. It is a logical specification to which a data value can conform, and that states what a conforming data value means. The meaning of a data element value is a combination of an object class and a property, such as person and name. A data element also has a value domain – its set of permissible values.&#xD;
When ISO/IEC 11179 is applied to a relational database, each table represents an object class, each column represents a data element, and each row represents an object and contains the values of the column data elements for that object.&#xD;
Usually, the table names and column names suggest the meaning of the data in a relational database. Formal documentation can describe the meaning more rigorously. Such documentation is a kind of metadata. ISO/IEC 11179 documents the standardization and registration of metadata to make data understandable and shareable.</documentation>

      <documentation>O-DEF™ Standard&#xD;
The Open Data Element Framework (O-DEF) (see References) is a standard of The Open Group based on ISO/IEC 11179 that defines a framework for describing common data element concepts, with an initial index (to be extended over time) of object classes, properties, and roles. (A data element concept is a generic data element, with an object class and property, but no defined value domain.)&#xD;
The O-DEF Standard aids interoperability by enabling basic units of data to be classified, using specific object class and property codes, so that equivalences and similarities between the data can be easily determined.&#xD;
The O-DEF Standard also incorporates codes from existing international standards that can become plug-ins; for example, the product codes in the O-DEF Standard are drawn from the UNSPSC.</documentation>

A standard data model13 or Industry Standard Data Model (ISDM) is a data model that is widely applied in some industry, and shared amongst competitors to some degree. There are a number of standard data models, defined by industry bodies, vendors, and others. Many use ERA modeling notations to describe relational structures. Others take the form of hierarchical vocabularies. A particularly extensive standard data model is the US National Information Exchange Model™ (NIEM™).14 The NIEM model includes core elements and elements specific to particular communities.</documentation>

      <documentation>RDF Triple Stores&#xD;
In the RDF, the subject of a triple represents a real-world object, the triple’s verb represents a property, and the triple’s object represents the value of the property for the subject. This value can be a real-world object or a data value such as a number, a text string, or an image.&#xD;
Real-world objects and properties that are triple subjects, verbs, and objects are identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI).15 An IRI can be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that gives the location of a web page, so that the value representing the object or property points to a web page that describes it.16&#xD;
The RDF Schema (RDFS)17 standard defines the meaning of object class and property for the RDF. Fundamentally, this is not very different to what is meant in ISO/IEC 11179. The Web Ontology Language (OWL)18 is a standard language, based on RDF, for defining ontologies. An ontology describes object classes and properties, and relationships between them. An OWL ontology can be a powerful collection of metadata.&#xD;
RDF, RDFS, and OWL can be used to define standard vocabularies, including the examples given in Table 12.&#xD;

Each XML element represents an object, and its attributes are typed data entities that are the values of properties. The content of an element includes child elements that can be regarded as objects that are the values of other properties. As with the names of tables and columns in a relational database schema, the names of elements and attributes in a DTD or XML Schema Definition (XSD) imply some correspondence with the real world.&#xD;
An approach to XML semantics was proposed in the W3C in 2001,19 but this appears not to have resulted in a formal standard.&#xD;

It includes XSL Transformations (XSLT), which is a language for transforming an XML document into another XML document, or another type of document, such as HTML or Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML™) that is recognized by a browser. A transformation is defined in a transformation template, which contains rules to apply when an XML node is matched in the input. XSLT is a powerful language, capable of arbitrary computations. It is widely supported by web browsers.&#xD;

      <documentation>Name: Turing eXtender Language (TXL)&#xD;
Description: A programming language designed to support computer software analysis and source transformation tasks. A TXL program specifies the structure of the input to be transformed using an extended form of BNF, and gives rules for rewriting the input to produce output. It enables structural analysis and transformation of formal notations, and has been used in a wide range of applications, including database schema translation.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Science&#xD;
Data analysis and transformation are related to data science,26 which is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from collections of structured and unstructured data.&#xD;
The Data Science Association27 has formed a committee to define formal standards for data science.&#xD;
The Open Group has defined the Open Certified Data Scientist (Open CDS) certification program,28 to provide certification of the competence of data science professionals.</documentation>

      <documentation>Structured Data Query Languages&#xD;
Data structure query standards can be used to parse data, or to define the structure of the source and target of a transformation. So, for example, a program can be written in SQL, SPARQL,29 or XML Query (XQuery)30 in order to read data from a source and write it to a destination after transformation.</documentation>

      <documentation>Machine Learning&#xD;
With programs such as UNIX sed and implementations of XSLT, the analysis or transformation is defined by a fixed specification, such as a sed script or transformation template, which is interpreted by an application-agnostic program. In an ML system, the definition of the analysis or transformation is modified in the light of results; the system learns what it has to do. ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can be used for data analysis and transformation.&#xD;
A particular form of data analysis that is relevant to data integration is the analysis of human-readable content. This is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes Sentiment Analysis, which assesses whether a piece of human-readable content is positively or negatively disposed towards a product or proposition.&#xD;
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 4232 is the sub-committee of the joint technical committee of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) responsible for standardization in the area of AI. Its work program includes:&#xD;
• AI framework, concepts, terminology, and computational approaches&#xD;
• Quality model for AI-based systems&#xD;
• Robustness of neural networks&#xD;
• Analytics using AI and big data&#xD;
• Functional safety, risk management, ethical and societal concerns, bias, and governance&#xD;
• Use-cases</documentation>

      <documentation>Appendix B: Development of EA Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
The development of architecture principles is typically influenced by the following :&#xD;
•	Enterprise mission and plans: The mission, plans, and organizational infrastructure of the enterprise. &#xD;
•	Enterprise strategic initiatives: The characteristics of the enterprise; its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and its current enterprise-wide initiatives (such as process improvement and quality management). &#xD;
•	External constraints: Market factors (time-to-market imperatives, customer expectations, etc.); existing and potential legislation. &#xD;
•	Current systems and technology: The set of information resources deployed within the enterprise, including systems documentation, equipment inventories, network configuration diagrams, policies, and procedures. &#xD;
•	Emerging industry trends: Predictions about economic, political, technical, and market factors that influence the enterprise environment. &#xD;
&#xD;
The EA Principles are developed by following a systematic process to create, socialize, approve and communicate them to ensure that they will have the desired effect. This process involves the following five key steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 1- Identification of the EA Principles: The EA Principles identified in this document were mostly derived from previous EA Principle documents. The following main sources were consulted and leveraged: &#xD;
•	The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Treasury Board defined Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	(Draft) DFO-MPO Enterprise Architecture Principles;&#xD;
•	Correctional Service Canada (CSC) defined Architecture Principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 2- Definition of the EA Principles: Once identified, the principles are further defined along the following five criteria and properly documented to fit ESDC’s business needs. EA Principles should be few in number and future-oriented.&#xD;
•	Understandable: The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous so that it can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization.&#xD;
•	Robust: The principle will enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made and enforceable policies and standards to be created. Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-making in complex, potentially controversial situations.&#xD;
•	Complete: Every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined. The principles cover every situation perceived.&#xD;
•	Consistent: Strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle. The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance of interpretations. &#xD;
•	Stable: Principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate change. An amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering principles after they are initially ratified.&#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 3 – Revision of EA Principles: Architects within EA/IM Directorate are initially engaged to review and revise the proposed EA Principles. Following that initial revision, some additional key stakeholders could also be engaged in the revision as required. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 4 – Governance and Communication: Once the revision is completed and the EA Principles are agreed upon, they will be governed, endorsed and communicated within ESDC. Senior management will then champion the EA Principles. &#xD;
&#xD;
	Step 5 – Leveraging the EA principles: The EA Principles will be used as an important tool for Departmental governance within the Gating process of any technology projects. They provide a firm foundation for making architecture and planning decisions, framing policies, procedures and standards, and supporting resolution of contradictory situations.</documentation>

      <documentation>Appendix A: Glossary&#xD;
This section is normative.&#xD;
&#xD;
This appendix contains definitions for all of the significant/important/unfamiliar terms used in the normative parts of this standard, including terms used in the Conformance section. Please consult http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/ for more information on the role of definitions in standards quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
accessibility problems&#xD;
ATAG 2.0 recognizes two types of accessibility problems:&#xD;
authoring tool user interface accessibility problems: Aspects of an authoring tool user interface that does not meet a success criterion in Part A of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
web content accessibility problems (WCAG): Aspects of web content that does not meet a WCAG 2.0 success criterion (Level A, AA or AAA).&#xD;
accessibility information (WCAG)&#xD;
Information that web content must contain in order to meet a WCAG 2.0 success criterion (Level A, AA or AAA). Examples include: programmatically associated alternative content (e.g. text alternatives for images), role, and state information for widgets, relationships within complex tables).&#xD;
Note: For the purposes of ATAG 2.0, only programmatically determinable accessibility information qualifies. For additional examples, see Appendix A of the Implementing ATAG 2.0 document.&#xD;
accessible content support features&#xD;
Any features of an authoring tool that directly support authors in increasing the accessibility of the web content being edited. These are features that must be present to meet the success criteria in Part B of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
alternative content&#xD;
Web content that is used in place of other content that some people are not able to access. Alternative content fulfills essentially the same function or purpose as the original content. WCAG 2.0 recognizes several general types of alternative content:&#xD;
text alternatives for non-text content: Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. For example, an image of a chart might have two text alternatives: a description in the paragraph after the chart and a short text alternative for the chart indicating in words that a description follows.&#xD;
alternatives for time-based media: Web content that serves the same function or purpose as one or more tracks in a time-based media presentation. This includes: captions, audio descriptions, extended audio descriptions, sign language interpretation as well as correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and auditory information that also is capable of achieving the outcomes of any interactivity in the time-based presentation.&#xD;
media alternative for text: Media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives). A media alternative for text is provided for people who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.&#xD;
Importantly, from the perspective of authoring tools, alternative content may or may not be:&#xD;
programmatically associated alternative content: Alternative content whose location and purpose can be programmatically determined from the original content for which it is serving as an alternative. For example, a paragraph might serve as a text alternative for an image, but it is only programmatically associated if this relationship is properly encoded (e.g. by &quot;aria-labeledby&quot;).&#xD;
Note: ATAG 2.0 typically refers to programmatically associated alternative content.&#xD;
assistive technology&#xD;
Software (or hardware), separate from the authoring tool, that provides functionality to meet the requirements of people with disabilities (authors and end users). Some authoring tools may also provide direct accessibility features. Examples include:&#xD;
screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual, and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;&#xD;
screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or Braille;&#xD;
text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;&#xD;
speech recognition software, which are used by some people who have some physical disabilities;&#xD;
alternative keyboards, which are used by some people with physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff, and other special input devices);&#xD;
alternative pointing devices, which are used by some people with physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.&#xD;
audio&#xD;
The technology of sound reproduction. Audio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real-world sounds, or both.&#xD;
author actions preventing generation of accessible web content&#xD;
When the actions of authors prevent authoring tools from generating accessible web content (WCAG). Examples include: turning off accessible content support features, ignoring prompts for accessibility information (WCAG), providing faulty accessibility information (WCAG) at prompts, modifying the authoring tool (e.g. via scripting, macros), and installing plug-ins.&#xD;
authors&#xD;
People who use authoring tools to create or modify web content. The term may cover roles such as content authors, designers, programmers, publishers, testers, etc. (see Part B Conformance Applicability Note 6: Multiple authoring roles). Some authoring tools control who may be an author by managing author permissions.&#xD;
author permission&#xD;
Authorization that allows modification of given web content.&#xD;
authoring action&#xD;
Any action that authors can take using the authoring tool user interface that results in editing web content (e.g. typing text, deleting, inserting an element, applying a template). In contrast, most authoring tool user interfaces also enable actions that do not edit content (e.g. saving, publishing, setting preferences, viewing documentation).&#xD;
reversible authoring action: An authoring action that can be immediately and completely undone by the authoring tool upon a cancel request by an author. Examples of cancel requests include: &quot;cancel&quot;, &quot;undo&quot;, &quot;redo&quot; (when it used to reverse &quot;undo&quot;), &quot;revert&quot;, and &quot;roll-back&quot;&#xD;
Note: It is acceptable for an authoring tool to collect a series of text entry actions (e.g. typed words, a series of backspaces) into a single reversible authoring action.&#xD;
authoring outcome&#xD;
The content or content modifications that result from authoring actions. Authoring outcomes are cumulative (e.g. text is entered, then styled, then made into a link, then given a title).&#xD;
authoring practice&#xD;
An approach that authors follow to achieve a given authoring outcome (e.g. controlling presentation with style sheets). Depending on the design of an authoring tool, authoring practices may be chosen by authors or by the authoring tool. Authoring practices may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible authoring practices (WCAG): An authoring practice in which the authoring outcome conforms to WCAG 2.0 at Level A, AA, or AAA. Some accessible authoring practices require accessibility information (WCAG).&#xD;
authoring session&#xD;
A state of the authoring tool in which web content can be edited by an author.&#xD;
end of an authoring session: The point at which the author has no further opportunity to make authoring actions without starting another session. The end of an authoring session may be determined by authors (e.g. closing a document, publishing) or by the authoring tool (e.g. when the authoring tool transfers editing permission to another author on a collaborative system).&#xD;
Note: The end of the authoring session is distinct from publishing. Automatic content generation may continue after the end of both the authoring session and initial publishing (e.g. content management system updates).&#xD;
authoring tool&#xD;
Any web-based or non-web-based application(s) that can be used by authors (alone or collaboratively) to create or modify web content for use by other people (other authors or end users).&#xD;
Note 1: &quot;application(s)&quot;: ATAG 2.0 may be conformed to by stand-alone applications or by collections of applications. If a conformance claim is made, then the claim must provide identifying information for each application and also for any required extensions, plug-ins, etc.&#xD;
Note 2: &quot;alone or collaboratively&quot;: Multiple authors may contribute to the creation of web content and, depending on the authoring tool, each author may work with different views of the content and different author permissions.&#xD;
Note 3: &quot;to create or modify web content&quot;: This clause rules out software that collects data from a person for other purposes (e.g. online grocery order form) and then creates web content from that data (e.g. a web-based warehouse order) without informing the person (however, WCAG 2.0 would still apply). This clause also rules out software used to create content exclusively in non-web content technologies.&#xD;
Note 4: &quot;for use by other people&quot;: This clause rules out the many web applications that allow people to modify web content that only they themselves experience (e.g. web-based email display settings) or that only provide input to automated processes (e.g. library catalog search page).&#xD;
Examples of software that are generally considered authoring tools under ATAG 2.0:&#xD;
web page authoring tools (e.g. WYSIWYG HTML editors)&#xD;
software for directly editing source code&#xD;
software for converting to web content technologies (e.g. &quot;Save as HTML&quot; features in office document applications)&#xD;
integrated development environments (e.g. for web application development)&#xD;
software that generates web content on the basis of templates, scripts, command-line input or &quot;wizard&quot;-type processes&#xD;
software for rapidly updating portions of web pages (e.g. blogging, wikis, online forums)&#xD;
software for generating/managing entire websites (e.g. content management systems, courseware tools, content aggregators)&#xD;
email clients that send messages using web content technologies&#xD;
multimedia authoring tools&#xD;
software for creating mobile web applications&#xD;
Examples of software that are not considered authoring tools under ATAG 2.0 (in all cases, WCAG 2.0 still applies if the software is web-based):&#xD;
customizable personal portals: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because the web content being edited is only available to the owner of the portal&#xD;
e-commerce order forms: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because the purpose of an e-commerce order form is to order a product, not communicate with other people via web content, even if the data collected by the form actually does result in web content (e.g. online tracking pages)&#xD;
stand-alone accessibility checkers: ATAG 2.0 does not apply because a stand-alone accessibility checker with no automated or semi-automated repair functionality does not actually modify web content. An accessibility checker with repair functionality or that is considered as part of a larger authoring process would be considered an authoring tool.&#xD;
authoring tool user interface&#xD;
The display and control mechanism that authors use to operate the authoring tool software. User interfaces may be non-web-based or web-based or a combination (e.g. a non-web-based authoring tool might have web-based help pages):&#xD;
authoring tool user interface (non-web-based): Any parts of an authoring tool user interface that are not implemented as web content and instead run directly on a platform that is not a user agent (e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Java Virtual Machine, iOS, Android).&#xD;
authoring tool user interface (web-based): Any parts of an authoring tool user interface that are implemented using web content technologies and are accessed by authors via a user agent.&#xD;
Authoring tool user interfaces may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible authoring tool user interfaces: Authoring tool user interfaces that meet the success criteria of a level in Part A of ATAG 2.0.&#xD;
checking, accessibility&#xD;
The process by which web content is evaluated for web content accessibility problems (WCAG). ATAG 2.0 recognizes three types of checking, based on increasing levels of automation of the tests:&#xD;
manual checking: Checking in which the tests are carried out by authors. This includes the case where authors are aided by instructions or guidance provided by the authoring tool, but where authors must carry out the actual test procedure.&#xD;
semi-automated checking: Checking in which the tests are partially carried out by the authoring tool, but where authors' input or judgment is still required to decide or help decide the outcome of the tests.&#xD;
automated checking: Checking in which the tests are carried out automatically by the authoring tool without any intervention by authors.&#xD;
An authoring tool may support any combination of checking types.&#xD;
content (web content)&#xD;
Information and sensory experience to be communicated to the end user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions. In ATAG 2.0, the term is primarily used to refer to the output that is produced by the authoring tool. Content produced by authoring tools may include web applications, including those that act as web-based authoring tools. Content may or may not be:&#xD;
accessible content (WCAG): Content that would conform to WCAG 2.0, at either Level A, AA, or AAA, assuming that any web content technologies relied upon to satisfy the WCAG 2.0 success criteria are accessibility supported.&#xD;
Note 1: If accessibility support for the relied upon technologies is lacking, then the content will not conform to WCAG 2.0 and one or more groups of end users with disabilities will likely experience difficulty accessing the content.&#xD;
Note 2: Conformance to WCAG 2.0, even at the highest level (i.e. Level AAA), still may not make content &quot;accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability&quot;.&#xD;
content being edited: The web content that an author can modify during an authoring session. The content being edited may be a complete piece of content (e.g. image, style sheet) or only part of a larger piece of content (e.g. a status update). The content being edited only includes content in web content technologies that the authoring tool supports (e.g. a WYSIWYG HTML editor allows editing of the HTML content of a web page editable, but not the images).&#xD;
content properties&#xD;
The individual pieces of information that make up the web content (e.g. the attributes and contents of elements, style sheet information).&#xD;
content (structured)&#xD;
Web content that includes machine-readable internal structure (e.g. markup elements), as opposed to unstructured content, such as raster image formats or plain human language text.&#xD;
content generation (content authoring, content editing)&#xD;
The act of specifying the actual web content that will be rendered, played or executed by the end user's user agent. While the precise details of how content is created in any given system may vary widely, responsibility for the generation of content can be any combination of the following:&#xD;
author generated content: Web content for which authors are fully responsible. The author may only be responsible down to a particular level (e.g. when asked to type a text label, the author is responsible for the text, but not for how the label is marked up; when typing markup in a source editing-view, the author is not responsible for the fact that UNICODE is used to encode the text ).&#xD;
automatically-generated content: Web content for which developer-programmed functionality is fully responsible (e.g. what markup to output when an author requests to start a new document, automatically correcting markup errors).&#xD;
third-party content generation: Web content for which a third-party author is responsible (e.g. community shared templates).&#xD;
content rendering&#xD;
User interface functionality that authoring tools present if they render, play or execute the web content being edited. ATAG 2.0 recognizes several types of content renderings:&#xD;
conventional renderings (or &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;): When content is rendered in a way that is similar to the default rendering a user agent would create from the same content. While &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;, standing for &quot;What-you-see-is-what-you-get&quot; is the common term, differences between user agents and end user settings mean that in reality there is no single typical end user experience; or&#xD;
unconventional renderings: When content is rendered differently than it would be in a typical user agent (e.g. rendering an audio file as a graphical waveform); or&#xD;
partial renderings: When some aspects of the content are rendered, played, or executed, but not others (e.g. a frame-by-frame video editor renders the graphical, but not the timing aspects, of a video).&#xD;
content transformations&#xD;
Processes that take content in one web content technology or non-web content technology (e.g. a word processing format) as input and produce content that has been optimized, restructured or recoded:&#xD;
Optimizing Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology is not changed and the structural features of the content technology that are employed also stay the same. Changes would not be expected to result in information loss (e.g. removing whitespace, replacing in-line styles with an external style sheet).&#xD;
Restructuring Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology stays the same, but the structural features of the technology used to markup the content are changed (e.g. linearizing tables, splitting a document into pages.&#xD;
Recoding Content Transformations: Transformations in which the content technology used to encode the content is changed (e.g. HTML to XHTML, a word processing format to HTML).&#xD;
Note: Clipboard operations, in which content is copied to or pasted from the platform clipboard, are not considered content transformations.&#xD;
control settings&#xD;
Settings that relate to how authors operate the authoring tool, for example using the keyboard or mouse.&#xD;
developer&#xD;
Any entities or individuals responsible for programming the authoring tool. This includes the programmers of any additional software components included by the Claimant in the conformance claim. In some cases, development of the authoring tool is complete before authors can use it to publish web content. However, in other cases (e.g. some web-based authoring tools), the developer may continue to modify the authoring tool even after content has been published, such that the content experienced by the end user is modified.&#xD;
direct accessibility features&#xD;
Features of an authoring tool that provide functionality to meet the requirements of authors with disabilities (e.g. keyboard navigation, zoom features, text-to-speech). Additional or specialized functionality may still be provided by external assistive technology.&#xD;
display settings&#xD;
Settings that relate to how authors perceive the authoring tool. These include:&#xD;
audio display settings: the characteristics of audio output of music, sounds, and speech. Examples include volume, speech voices, voice speed, and voice emphasis.&#xD;
visual display settings: the characteristics of the on-screen rendering of text and graphics. Examples include fonts, sizes, colors, spacing, positioning, and contrast.&#xD;
tactile display settings: the characteristics of haptic output. Examples include the magnitude of the haptic forces and the types of vibration.&#xD;
documentation&#xD;
Any information that supports the use of an authoring tool. This information may be provided electronically or otherwise and includes help, manuals, installation instructions, sample work flows, tutorials, etc.&#xD;
document object&#xD;
The internal representation of data in the source by a non-web based authoring tool or user agent. The document object may form part of a platform accessibility service that enables communication with assistive technologies. Web-based authoring tools are considered to make use of the document object that is maintained by the user agent.&#xD;
element&#xD;
A pair of markup tags and its content, or an &quot;empty tag&quot; (one that requires no closing tag or content).&#xD;
end user&#xD;
A person who interacts with web content once it has been authored. This includes people using assistive technologies.&#xD;
human language&#xD;
Language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans.&#xD;
informative&#xD;
For information purposes and not required for conformance.&#xD;
keyboard interface&#xD;
Keyboard interfaces are programmatic services provided by many platforms that allow operation in a device independent manner. A keyboard interface can allow keystroke input even if particular devices do not contain a hardware keyboard (e.g. a touchscreen-controlled device can have a keyboard interface built into its operating system to support onscreen keyboards as well as external keyboards that may be connected).&#xD;
Note: Keyboard-operated mouse emulators, such as MouseKeys, do not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because these emulators use pointing device interfaces, not keyboard interfaces.&#xD;
keyboard trap&#xD;
A user interface situation in which a keyboard interface may be used to move focus to, but not from, a user interface component or group of components.&#xD;
label&#xD;
Text or other component with a text alternative that is presented to users to identify a component. A label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.&#xD;
live&#xD;
Information captured from a real-world event that is published with no more than a broadcast delay.&#xD;
Note: A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order to give the broadcaster time to queue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient to allow significant editing.&#xD;
markup language&#xD;
A system of text annotations (e.g. elements in HTML) and processing rules that may be used to specify the structure, presentation or semantics of content. Examples of markup languages include HTML and SVG.&#xD;
markup of some content is the set of annotations that appear in the content.&#xD;
name&#xD;
Text by which software can identify a user interface component to the author or end user. The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.&#xD;
non-text content&#xD;
Any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language. This includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, and images representing text.&#xD;
normative&#xD;
Required for conformance. One may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to ATAG 2.0. Content identified as &quot;informative&quot; or &quot;non-normative&quot; is never required for conformance.&#xD;
option&#xD;
When an author is presented with choices.&#xD;
default option: A setting or value for an option that is assigned automatically by the authoring tool and remains in effect unless canceled or changed by the author.&#xD;
platform&#xD;
The software environment within which the authoring tool operates. Platforms provide a consistent operational environment on top of lower level software platforms or hardware. For web-based authoring user interfaces, the most relevant platform will be a user agent (e.g. browser). For non-web-based user interfaces, the range of platforms includes, but may not be limited to, desktop operating systems (e.g. GNOME desktop on Linux, Mac OS, Windows), mobile operating systems (e.g. Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone), or cross-OS environments (e.g. Java), etc.&#xD;
Note 1: Many platforms mediate communication between applications operating on the platform and assistive technology via a platform accessibility service.&#xD;
Note 2: Accessibility guidelines for developers exist for many platforms.&#xD;
platform accessibility service&#xD;
A programmatic interface that is specifically engineered to provide communication between applications and assistive technologies (e.g. MSAA, IAccessible2 and UI Automation for Windows applications, AXAPI for Mac OS X applications, GNOME Accessibility Toolkit API for GNOME applications, Java Access for Java applications). On some platforms, it may be conventional to enhance communication further by implementing a document object.&#xD;
plug-in&#xD;
A program that runs as part of the authoring tool (e.g. a third-party checking and repair tool) and that is not part of web content being edited. Authors generally choose to include or exclude plug-ins from their authoring tool.&#xD;
pre-authored content&#xD;
Pieces of web content, created prior to an authoring session, that the authoring tool developer makes available to authors to use in the content being edited. Examples include clip art, sample videos, user interface widgets.&#xD;
Note 1: For templates, an incomplete form of pre-authored content, see Guideline B.2.4.&#xD;
Note 2: If the authoring tool uses pre-authored content automatically, see Guideline B.1.1.&#xD;
accessible pre-authored content (WCAG): Pre-authored content that is either already accessible web content (WCAG) or would be accessible, if it was appropriately inserted into an empty document.&#xD;
Note: If extensive author input is required to make use of pre-authored content, then the content may in fact be a template.&#xD;
pre-authored content selection mechanism&#xD;
A function beyond standard file selection that allows authors to select pre-authored content to use in an authoring session (e.g. clip art gallery, widget palette).&#xD;
presentation&#xD;
Rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by authors or end users.&#xD;
programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)&#xD;
Information that is encoded in a way that allows different software, including assistive technologies, to extract and present the information in different modalities. ATAG 2.0 uses this term in two contexts:&#xD;
Processing content: Whether the authoring tool is able to extract information from the web content (e.g. to extract the language of content from the markup).&#xD;
Communication between the authoring tool and assistive technology: For non-web-based user interfaces, this means making use of platform accessibility services, APIs, and, in some cases, document object models. For web-based user interfaces, this means ensuring that the user agent can pass on the information (e.g. through the use of WAI-ARIA).&#xD;
prominence&#xD;
A heuristic measure of how likely authors are to notice a user interface component in a user interface that they are operating. Prominence is affected by numerous factors, including: the number of navigation steps required, the reading order position, visual properties (e.g. size, spacing, color), and even the modality of use (e.g. mouse vs. keyboard use).&#xD;
at least as prominent: For ATAG 2.0, a user interface component A is considered to be &quot;at least as prominent&quot; as another component B when, from a default state, component A becomes displayed (and enabled) with the same number or less &quot;opening&quot; actions than are required for component B to become displayed (and enabled).&#xD;
Note 1: When a container is open, all of the enabled components in the container (e.g. items in a list, items in a menu, buttons in a toolbar, all components in a dialog box) are considered to be displayed (and therefore are at least as prominent as each other), even if the container must be scrolled for them to become visible. This takes into account that different screen sizes and author settings will affect which components are visible at a given time.&#xD;
Note 2: &quot;Opening actions&quot; are actions made by authors on components within the user interface that result in new components becoming displayed or enabled. For example: (a) keyboard shortcut to a top-level menu item to display a sub-menu, (b) keyboard selection on a button to display a dialog box, (c) mouse click on a checkbox to enable previously disabled sub-items, etc. Actions that do not cause new components to become actionable (e.g. moving focus, scrolling a list), are not counted as &quot;opening actions&quot;.&#xD;
Note 3: Keyboard shortcuts to components in closed containers are not counted as &quot;opening actions&quot; because the components have no prominence when they are not displayed. The same is true when authors must use &quot;search&quot; to reveal components in closed containers.&#xD;
Note 4: The &quot;default state&quot; is the state of the authoring tool at the beginning of an authoring session as set by the developer. The default state of many document authoring tools is an editing-view.&#xD;
prompt&#xD;
Any authoring tool initiated request for a decision or piece of information from authors. The term covers both requests that must be responded to immediately (e.g. modal dialog boxes) as well as less urgent requests (e.g. underlining a misspelled word).&#xD;
publishing&#xD;
Any point at which the authors or authoring tool make web content available to end users (e.g. uploading a web page, committing a change in a wiki, live streaming).&#xD;
range&#xD;
More than one item within a multi-item set.&#xD;
Informative Note: ATAG 2.0 uses the term &quot;range&quot; where absolute measurements may not be practical (e.g. the set of all help documentation examples, the set of all templates). While the strict testable requirement is the definition &quot;More than one item within a multi-item set&quot;, implementers are strongly encouraged to implement the success criteria more broadly.&#xD;
relationships&#xD;
Meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content.&#xD;
repair (accessibility)&#xD;
The process by which web content accessibility problems that have been identified within web content are resolved. ATAG 2.0 recognizes three types of repair, based on increasing levels of automation:&#xD;
manual repair: Where the repairs are carried out by authors. This includes the case where authors are aided by instructions or guidance provided by the authoring tool, but where authors carry out the actual repair procedure;&#xD;
semi-automated repair: Where the repairs are partially carried out by the authoring tool, but where authors' input or judgment is still required to complete the repair; and&#xD;
automated repair: Where the repairs are carried out automatically by the authoring tool without any intervention by authors.&#xD;
restrictions, restricted web content authoring&#xD;
When the web content that authors can specify with an authoring tool either must include or must not include certain content (e.g. elements, attributes, widgets). Many authoring tools restrict authoring in some way, which can either benefit accessibility (e.g. if text alternatives for non-text content are required) or detract from accessibility (e.g. if attributes for defining text alternatives are not available). In contrast, authoring tools that allow unrestricted web content authoring do not require any particular content to be included or not included (e.g. many source editing-views).&#xD;
role&#xD;
Text or a number by which software can identify the function of a component within web content (e.g. a string that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box).&#xD;
sequential keyboard access&#xD;
Using a keyboard interface to navigate the focus one-by-one through all of the items in an ordered set (e.g. menu items, form fields) until the desired item is reached and activated. This is in contrast to direct keyboard access methods such as keyboard shortcuts and the use of bypass links.&#xD;
technology (web content)&#xD;
A mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents. Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end user experiences that range from static web pages to multimedia presentations to dynamic web applications. Some common examples of web content technologies include HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, PDF, Flash, Silverlight, Flex, and JavaScript.&#xD;
template&#xD;
Content patterns that are filled in by authors or the authoring tool to produce web content for end users (e.g. document templates, content management templates, presentation themes). Often templates will pre-specify at least some authoring decisions.&#xD;
accessible templates (WCAG): Templates that can be filled in to create web content that meets the WCAG 2.0 success criteria (Level A, AA or AAA), when both of the following are true:&#xD;
The author correctly follows any instructions provided (e.g. correctly responding to prompts, correctly replacing highlighted placeholders); and&#xD;
No further authoring occurs&#xD;
Note: Under these conditions, some templates will result in completely empty documents, which are considered accessible by default.&#xD;
template selection mechanism&#xD;
A function beyond standard file selection that allows authors to select templates to use as the basis for new content or to apply to existing content.&#xD;
time limit&#xD;
The amount of time that an authoring tool provides to authors to perform a task (e.g. read a message, select an item, save a change). Examples include: authoring session timeouts, time-based presentations (e.g. tutorial video).&#xD;
tutorial&#xD;
A type of documentation that provides step-by-step instructions for performing multi-part tasks.&#xD;
user agent&#xD;
Any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with web content (e.g. web browsers, browser plug-ins, media players)&#xD;
In-Market User Agent: A user agent that can be procured by members of the public (free or otherwise). Usually, an in-market user agent will be a separate software from the authoring tool; however, sometimes a software may combine user agent and authoring tool functionality. These cases include:&#xD;
Preview-Only: If the user agent can only render web content that it receives from the associated authoring functionality, then the software is an authoring tool with a preview feature. Such preview-only features are not considered in-market user agents.&#xD;
User Agent with Authoring Tool Mode: If the user agent functionality must retrieve and open web content before it can be sent to the authoring tool functionality, then the software is a user agent with an authoring tool mode. If the user agent is used to preview content produced by the authoring tool mode, then it is to be considered an in-market user agent.&#xD;
Combined User Agent/Authoring Tool: A user agent in which the default mode of user interaction enables editing the web content. These tools do not need previews because the author is already experiencing the content in the same way as end users.&#xD;
user interface component&#xD;
A part of the user interface or content display (including content renderings) that is perceived by authors as a single control for a distinct function.&#xD;
video&#xD;
The technology of moving pictures or images. Video can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.&#xD;
view&#xD;
A user interface function that authors use to interact with the web content being edited. ATAG 2.0 categorizes views according to whether they support editing:&#xD;
editing-views: Views in which some or all of the content is editable; or&#xD;
previews: Views in which no authoring actions are provided (i.e. the view is not editable). Previews are provided to present the web content being edited by the authoring tool as it would appear to end users of user agents. Previews may be implemented using actual in-market user agents, but this is not necessary.&#xD;
ATAG 2.0 also recognizes several approaches to presenting the content in a view:&#xD;
source views: The content is presented in unrendered form (e.g. plain text editors); or&#xD;
rendered views: Content renderings (conventional, unconventional or partial) are presented; or&#xD;
property views: Only properties of the content are presented. The authoring tool then uses these properties to automatically generate the content to be published (e.g. CMS calendar widget that generates a calendar from the numeric month and year).&#xD;
workflow&#xD;
A customary sequence of steps or tasks that authors follow to produce a content deliverable. If an authoring tool is composed of a collection of applications (e.g. markup editor, image editor, and validation tool), then its workflows may include use of one or more of the applications.</documentation>

      <documentation>ESDC has a mandate to help build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives, and improve Canadians' quality of life. At the heart of this mandate are the policies, programs, services and benefits that support our most vulnerable -- the unemployed, people with disabilities, the homeless and the elderly. Last year alone, Service Canada provided $122 billion in direct benefits to 9.5 million Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure that ESDC can continue to deliver on this important mandate in the future, we have embarked on a department-wide transformation to improve the client experience during their journey with Employment Insurance (EI), Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) Programme is leading this transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
BDM Programme signifies a long-term commitment to modernization. Over the next 10 years, many projects will focus on improving our statutory programs in three key areas.  They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
Service Excellence: we want to deliver an outstanding experience for clients, delivering benefits and services when they need them. We also want an organization that embeds quality and integrity in service design.  &#xD;
Policy Agility: we want to be able to adapt policy rapidly to changing needs and priorities of Canadians and their government.&#xD;
Transformed Organization: we want our workforce to have the authority, skills, tools, and training to make it all happen. &#xD;
&#xD;
The four phases, called tranches, are moving at this deliberate pace to ensure changes are done properly and in an integrated way. It also means we can adjust the plan as we go and keep employees informed and prepared.</documentation>

1.4.3.1.	Data Lake &#xD;
The advent of “big data” tools is enabling organizations to detect patterns in data that may otherwise escape human recognition.  This is being further advanced with new tools in machine learning and artificial intelligence described below.  These tools are designed to access large data sets in a range of native formats, but such access cannot generally target mission critical systems for fear of adverse performance effects.  This long-standing performance issue remains true for supporting more traditional reporting and analytics techniques as well.  To enable state-of-the-art tools to operate, the industry has begun to co-locate large volumes of data in “raw” forms.  Such a repository is called a data lake, and by “raw” form it is meant that few, if any, operations are performed when the data is copied from operational systems into the data lake.  As a result, the data lake contains a complete and detailed copy of the organization’s assets, but stored in a very human-unfriendly form.  This is well suited to support two activities: big-data, machine learning and artificial intelligence operations performed by highly-skilled specialists, and extraction of key data into a data warehouse without interfering with mission critical systems as described below.  In the absence of a data lake, it is not possible to bring to bear many modern technological tools, and consequently there are likely many opportunities to improve service that remain hidden.  There is a business need to provide secure access to authorized users, including executives and analysts, to easy-to-use, reporting, dash-boarding, and visualization tools that require few technical skills and yet provide answers to basic business questions, in near-real-time, in a manner that does not adversely affect performance of operational systems, and enables access to integrated, enterprise-shared data.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Fabric&#xD;
A data fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment. It enables a single and consistent data management framework, which allows seamless data access and processing by design across otherwise siloed storage. It may use analytics to constantly monitor data pipelines and support the design, deployment, and utilization of diverse data. Gartner® Data and Analysis Trends, 2021 (see References) claim that this can reduce time for integration by 30%, deployment by 30%, and maintenance by 70%.&#xD;
A data fabric has an application interface, and often also a user interface. It gives the ability to write data, as well as to read it. The sources may be on-premise or in the cloud. Data fabrics deliver a unified, intelligent, and integrated end-to-end platform to support data use-cases. They provide the ability to deliver use-cases quickly by leveraging innovation in dynamic integration, distributed, and multi-cloud architectures, graph engines, and distributed in-memory and persistent memory platforms. Data fabric focuses on automating the process integration, transformation, preparation, curation, security, governance, and orchestration to enable analytics and insights quickly for business success. It minimizes complexity by automating processes, workflows, and pipelines, generating code, and streamlining data to accelerate various use-cases.&#xD;
An application can read data from or update data in multiple sources, describing the data in terms of a common data model. The read and update requests are converted by data platforms to requests that describe the data in terms of the source data models. The data is then obtained from the sources and integrated, or updated in the sources, by continual synchronization or dynamic query.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:SystemSoftware" name="Data Mesh" id="id-2dccbf34256a4c6b95d2eac82b52b165">
      <documentation>Data Mesh&#xD;
The concept of data mesh is related but slightly different to that of data fabric. A data mesh consists of data products, each of which meets a set of user needs and has assured levels of quality and security. A data product is a computing unit that includes data, code, and metadata, and uses a data platform. (A data platform can be shared by multiple data products.)&#xD;
A data mesh has domain-oriented, decentralized data ownership and management. It does not necessarily provide uniform access to the data, but the data products of a mesh can be exposed by data platforms as sources in a data fabric.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Node" name="Data Platforms" id="id-1b0546981be54fcfbe304f797090202e">
      <documentation>Data Platforms&#xD;
Data platforms are architecture components that connect to multiple sources and provide access to their data. They are key components of data fabrics and data meshes. They may import data from the sources but more usually, and more effectively, they use data virtualization. In either case, they transform the source data to fit a target schema, or expose the source schema to applications.&#xD;
Figure 3 shows how data platforms enable applications to access data. They may communicate with each other or use common metadata to make the access uniform.&#xD;

      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO BUILD A HEALTHIER TODAY AND TOMORROW&#xD;
&#xD;
Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, the Government has mandated vaccination for federal and federally-regulated workers, and for everyone travelling within Canada by plane, train, or ship. It has also ensured a standardized Canadian proof of vaccination for domestic and international use.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is securing next generation COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and doses for kids from 5 to 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
And around the world, Canada will continue working with its partners to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines and other resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build a healthy future, we must also strengthen our healthcare system and public health supports for all Canadians, especially seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities, and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is work to be done. On accessibility. On care in rural communities. On delayed procedures. On mental health and addiction treatment. On long-term care. On improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions and get the best possible results.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will work collaboratively with provinces, territories, and other partners to deliver real results on what Canadians need.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="This Is The Moment To Grow A More Resilient Economy" id="id-e1b0d12666eb4fe0b72c02c288970418">
      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GROW A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY&#xD;
&#xD;
The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good. But as we do, we should rebuild an economy that works for everyone. At the height of the lockdowns, the Government made historic, necessary investments so families could keep paying the rent and small businesses could stay afloat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, with one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, and employment back to pre-pandemic levels, the Government is moving to more targeted support, while&#xD;
prudently managing spending. &#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure no one is left behind, support will be extended or added for industries that continue to struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also continue making life more affordable for all Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inflation is a challenge that countries around the world are facing. And while Canada’s economic performance is better than many of our partners, we must keep tackling the rising cost of living. To do that, the Government’s plan includes two major priorities: housing and child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whether it is building more units per year, increasing affordable housing, or ending chronic homelessness, the Government is committed to working with its partners to get real results.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, the Housing Accelerator Fund will help municipalities build more and better, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also help families buy their first home sooner with a more flexible First-Time Home Buyer’s Incentive, a new Rent-to-Own program, and by reducing the closing costs for first-time buyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting families will make life more affordable for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Canada Child Benefit has already helped lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and will continue increasing to keep up with the cost of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue building the first-ever Canada-wide early learning and child care system. By the end of 2022, average fees for regulated child care will be cut in half in most of the provinces and territories. And in some places, this will even happen as early as the start of the year. Families will save thousands of dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four jurisdictions have not yet reached agreements on child care. Two are territories with unique infrastructure challenges, and the Government will keep working together to ensure we meet the needs of the North. The Government will continue working with the remaining two provinces to finalize agreements that will deliver $10-a-day child care for families who so badly need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in affordable child care – just like housing – is not just good for families. It helps grow the entire economy. And so does immigration.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will continue increasing immigration levels and reducing wait times, while supporting family reunification and delivering a world-leading refugee resettlement program.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="This Is The Moment For Bolder Climate Action" id="id-d24f0854442d42a3a0472f6ec77c7204">
      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT FOR BOLDER CLIMATE ACTION&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries – we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world’s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians’ pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada’s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Protecting Canadians From COVID-19" id="id-64dc6befe30f452f95795a6dcbb4110b">
      <documentation>The first foundation of the Government’s approach is protecting Canadians from COVID-19.&#xD;
This is priority number one.&#xD;
It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.&#xD;
Over the last six months, Canadians have stood united and strong. Their actions embody what has always been the purpose of the federal government: bringing Canadians together to achieve common goals.&#xD;
Personal protective equipment has been shipped across the country. Members of the Canadian Forces were there in long-term care homes. Close to 9 million Canadians were helped with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and over 3.5 million jobs were supported by the wage subsidy.&#xD;
The Government will continue to have people’s backs just like Canadians have each other’s backs.&#xD;
Through the first wave, contact tracing and testing ramped up across the country. The surge this fall further reinforces what we already know – that we must do even more.&#xD;
The federal government will be there to help the provinces increase their testing capacity. Canadians should not be waiting in line for hours to get a test.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government is pursuing every technology and every option for faster tests for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. As soon as tests are approved for safe use in Canada, the Government will do everything it can to see them deployed. The Government will also create a federal Testing Assistance Response Team to quickly meet surge testing needs, including in remote and isolated communities.&#xD;
Local public health authorities are the backbone of our nation’s efforts to stop outbreaks before they start. As members of the communities they protect, they know the devastating economic impact a lockdown order can have.&#xD;
To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders. To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.&#xD;
This will ensure that decisions are made with the health of Canadians as the first priority.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on what communities need more broadly.&#xD;
The Government has already invested over $19 billion for a Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories, to support everything from the capacity of health care systems to securing PPE.&#xD;
To address the challenges faced by provinces and territories as they reopen classrooms, the federal government invested $2 billion in the Safe Return to Class Fund, along with new funding for First Nations communities. This is money to keep kids – and staff – safe in the classroom, whether that’s by helping schools buy cleaning supplies or upgrade ventilation.&#xD;
These commitments build on federal investments to support people who are most at risk and those who care for them, including with the federal wage top-up for personal support workers. People on the frontlines who have been looking after seniors do vital work and the Government will continue to have their backs.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will continue to support Canadians as they take action to keep each other safe.&#xD;
Already, people are doing their part by wearing masks. That’s important, and we can build on that commitment. Working with private sector partners, the federal government created the COVID Alert app. Canadians living in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan now have an extra tool to keep themselves and others safe. The Government hopes all the others will sign on so that people in all parts of the country can both do their part and be better protected.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on getting Canadians the PPE they need.&#xD;
This spring, the Government issued a call, and thousands of Canadian businesses and manufacturers responded. From shop floors to companies big and small, Canada’s dynamic businesses met the challenge as their workers stepped up. &#xD;
And in less than six months, Canadians are now manufacturing almost all types of PPE. The Government will continue building that domestic capacity, while securing supply chains to keep Canadians safe and create jobs.&#xD;
Canadians are pulling together, whether that’s with PPE manufacturing, through the COVID Alert app, or by wearing a mask. In the same way, Canadian researchers and scientists are pitching in to the Team Canada effort with their knowledge and expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
VACCINE EFFORTS&#xD;
In the long run, the best way to end this pandemic is with a safe and effective vaccine.&#xD;
Canada’s vaccine strategy is all about ensuring that Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.&#xD;
There are many types of potential candidates. Canada is exploring the full range of options. The Government has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while investing in manufacturing here at home. And to get the vaccines out to Canadians once they’re ready, the Government has made further investments in our capacity for vaccine distribution.&#xD;
From the Vaccine Task Force that provides the best advice on vaccine purchasing and roll-out, to the Immunity Task Force looking at how COVID-19 is affecting vulnerable populations, Canada’s top scientific minds are guiding the Government every step of the way.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Helping Canadians Through The Pandemic" id="id-ef9a965abc7f46d099cac14fffc40925">
      <documentation>The medical and scientific fight against this virus is crucial. And so are the livelihoods of every single Canadian, worker, and family.&#xD;
So the second foundation of the Government’s approach is supporting Canadians through this crisis.&#xD;
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be short-lived.&#xD;
This is not the time for austerity. Canada entered this crisis in the best fiscal position of its peers. And the Government is using that fiscal firepower, on things like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, so that Canadians, businesses, and our entire economy have the support needed to weather the storm.&#xD;
Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
CREATING JOBS&#xD;
People losing their jobs is perhaps the clearest consequence of the global economic shock that Canadians – like those in other countries – have faced.&#xD;
The CERB helped people stay healthy at home while being able to keep food on the table.&#xD;
The CEWS helped people keep their jobs, or be rehired if they had been laid off.&#xD;
But there is still more to be done.&#xD;
Unemployment is in the double digits, and underemployment is high.&#xD;
Women, racialized Canadians, and young people have borne the brunt of job losses.&#xD;
Canadians need good jobs they can rely on.&#xD;
To help make that happen, the Government will launch a campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to previous levels. This will be done by using a range of tools, including direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to hire and retain workers.&#xD;
One way the Government will create these jobs is by extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy right through to next summer. The Government will work with businesses and labour to ensure the program meets the needs of the health and economic situation as it evolves.&#xD;
Another example of how the Government will create jobs is by significantly scaling up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, to provide more paid work experiences next year for young Canadians.&#xD;
Now, more than ever, Canadians must work together – including by eliminating remaining barriers between provinces to full, free internal trade – to get the economy back up and running and Canadians back to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES&#xD;
With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time.&#xD;
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.&#xD;
Over the coming months, the EI system will become the sole delivery mechanism for employment benefits, including for Canadians who did not qualify for EI before the pandemic. This pandemic has shown that Canada needs an EI system for the 21st century, including for the self-employed and those in the gig economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN IN THE ECONOMY&#xD;
Women – and in particular low-income women – have been hit hardest by COVID-19. This crisis has been described as a She-cession.&#xD;
Many women have bravely served on the frontlines of this crisis, in our communities or by shouldering the burden of unpaid care work at home.&#xD;
We must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women’s participation in the workforce, nor one of backtracking on the social and political gains women and allies have fought so hard to secure.&#xD;
The Government will create an Action Plan for Women in the Economy to help more women get back into the workforce and to ensure a feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery. This Plan will be guided by a task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole of government approach.&#xD;
It has been nearly 50 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women outlined the necessity of child care services for women’s social and economic equality. We have long understood that Canada cannot succeed if half of the population is held back. Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive, and high quality childcare.&#xD;
Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the Government will make a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system.&#xD;
The Government will build on previous investments, learn from the model that already exists in Quebec, and work with all provinces and territories to ensure that high-quality care is accessible to all.&#xD;
There is broad consensus from all parts of society, including business and labour leaders, that the time is now.&#xD;
The Government also remains committed to subsidizing before- and after-school program costs. With the way that this pandemic has affected parents and families, flexible care options for primary school children are more important than ever.&#xD;
The Government will also accelerate the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, which has already helped women across Canada grow their businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES&#xD;
As the Government invests in people, it will continue to support job-creating businesses.&#xD;
Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities and the backbone of the economy. The Government introduced a range of supports for Canadian businesses, from help with payroll through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to assistance with expenses through interest-free loans.&#xD;
COVID-19 has caused businesses across the country, both large and small, to rethink their approaches. Entrepreneurs and owners are looking at more digital options, more creative solutions, and more climate-friendly investments.&#xD;
The Government will help businesses adapt for the future and thrive.&#xD;
This fall, in addition to extending the wage subsidy, the Government will take further steps to bridge vulnerable businesses to the other side of the pandemic by:&#xD;
• Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account to help businesseswith fixed costs;&#xD;
• Improving the Business Credit Availability Program;&#xD;
• And introducing further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel and tourism, hospitality, and cultural industries like the performing arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY&#xD;
This COVID-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the Government had done less.&#xD;
With interest rates so low, central banks can only do so much to help. There is a global consensus that governments must do more. Government can do so while also locking in the low cost of borrowing for decades to come. This Government will preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage and continue to be guided by values of sustainability and prudence.&#xD;
There are two distinct needs. The first is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes, using whatever fiscal firepower is needed to support people and businesses during the pandemic. The best way to keep the economy strong is to keep Canadians healthy.&#xD;
The second need is to build back better, with a sustainable approach for future generations. As the Government builds a plan for stimulus and recovery, this must be done responsibly.&#xD;
In the longer term, the Government will focus on targeted investments to strengthen the middle class, build resiliency, and generate growth. The Government will also identify additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality, including by concluding work to limit the stock option deduction for wealthy individuals at large, established corporations, and addressing corporate tax avoidance by digital giants.&#xD;
Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change, and will change. The Government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media, and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music, and in writing.&#xD;
This fall, the Government will release an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out new measures to implement this Throne Speech.&#xD;
This update will make clear that the strength of the middle class, and the wellbeing of all Canadians, remain Canada’s key measures of success.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building Back Better: A Resilience Agenda For the Middle Class" id="id-a945092bd2314a8b971cf22528bfe499">
      <documentation>As we fight for every Canadian and defend everyone’s ability to succeed, we also need to focus on the future, and on building back better. This forms the third foundation of the Government’s approach.&#xD;
Around the world, advanced economies are realizing that things should not go back to business as usual. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities in our societies.&#xD;
The Government will create a resiliency agenda for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
This will include addressing the gaps in our social systems, investing in health care, and creating jobs. It will also include fighting climate change, and maintaining a commitment to fiscal sustainability and economic growth as the foundation of a strong and vibrant society.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING GAPS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS&#xD;
Central to this is recognizing that one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care homes. Elders deserve to be safe, respected, and live in dignity.&#xD;
Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside the provinces and territories.&#xD;
The Government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible;&#xD;
• And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to increasing Old Age Security once a senior turns 75, and boosting the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit.&#xD;
The Government will look at further targeted measures for personal support workers, who do an essential service helping the most vulnerable in our communities. Canada must better value their work and their contributions to our society.&#xD;
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities, and highlighted long-standing challenges. The Government will bring forward a Disability Inclusion Plan, which will have:&#xD;
• A new Canadian Disability Benefit modelled after the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors;&#xD;
• A robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;&#xD;
• And a better process to determine eligibility for Government disability programs and benefits.&#xD;
Over the last six months, it has become clearer than ever why Canadians need a resilient health care system.&#xD;
The Government will ensure that everyone – including in rural and remote areas – has access to a family doctor or primary care team. COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to address the opioid epidemic tearing through communities, which is an ongoing and worsening public health crisis. Additionally, the Government will further increase access to mental health resources. All Canadians should have the care they need, when they need it. We will all be stronger for it.&#xD;
The same goes for access to the medicine that keeps people healthy. Many Canadians who had drug plans through work lost this coverage when they were laid off because of the pandemic. So this is exactly the right moment to ramp up efforts to address that.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:&#xD;
• Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;&#xD;
• Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low; &#xD;
• And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.&#xD;
In addition to good health infrastructure, Canadians also need strong, safe communities to call home.&#xD;
The Government has banned assault-style firearms. The Government will also continue implementing firearms policy commitments, including:&#xD;
• Giving municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns;&#xD;
• And strengthening measures to control the flow of illegal guns into Canada.&#xD;
Women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built. The Government will accelerate investments in shelters and transition housing, and continue to advance with a National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence.&#xD;
To keep building strong communities, over the next two years the Government will also invest in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband, and affordable housing, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and northern communities.&#xD;
In the last six months, many more people have worked from home, done classes from the kitchen table, shopped online, and accessed government services remotely. So it has become more important than ever that all Canadians have access to the internet.&#xD;
The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.&#xD;
And to further link our communities together, the Government will work with partners to support regional routes for airlines. It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services. This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development. The Government will work to support this.&#xD;
Strong communities are places where everyone has a safe, affordable home. No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.&#xD;
This week, the Government invested more than $1 billion for people experiencing homelessness, including for this fall.&#xD;
In 2017, the Government announced that it would reduce chronic homelessness by 50 percent. The Government has already helped more than a million people get a safe and affordable place to call home. Given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also make substantial investments in housing for Canadians.&#xD;
The Government will add to the historic National Housing Strategy announced in 2017 by increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term, and partnering with not-for-profits and co-ops in the mid- to long-term. For the middle class, the Government will also move forward with enhancements to the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, including in Canada’s largest cities, so families can afford to buy their first home.&#xD;
Housing is something everyone deserves, and it’s also a key driver of the economy. Construction projects create jobs, and having a home is critical so people can contribute to their communities.&#xD;
Just like everyone deserves a home, everyone deserves to be able to put nutritious food on the table.&#xD;
The pandemic has made that harder for Canadians. The Government will continue to work with partners – including directly with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners – to address food insecurity in Canada. The Government will also strengthen local food supply chains here in Canada.&#xD;
The Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food – from people picking fruit to packing seafood – have done an outstanding job getting good food on people’s plates. They deserve the Government’s full support and protection.&#xD;
The Government will also ensure that those in Canada’s supply managed sectors receive full and fair compensation for recent trade agreements. Farmers keep our families fed, and we will continue to help them succeed and grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
A STRONGER WORKFORCE&#xD;
This pandemic has revealed gaps in health, housing, and food supply. And it has also laid bare inequalities Canadians face in the workforce.&#xD;
We have an opportunity to not just support Canadians, but grow their potential. Working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers. This will include by:&#xD;
• Supporting Canadians as they build new skills in growing sectors;&#xD;
• Helping workers receive education and accreditation;&#xD;
• And strengthening workers’ futures, by connecting them to employers and good jobs, in order to grow and strengthen the middle class.&#xD;
From researchers developing vaccines, to entrepreneurs building online stores, this pandemic has reminded us of the power of the knowledge economy, and how vital it is for our future.&#xD;
Canadians are leading, and they should have government services that keep up.&#xD;
The Government will make generational investments in updating outdated IT systems to modernize the way that Government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, from people looking for work to those living with a disability.&#xD;
The Government will also work to introduce free, automatic tax filing for simple returns to ensure citizens receive the benefits they need.&#xD;
Government must remain agile, and ready for what lies ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKING ACTION ON EXTREME RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE&#xD;
Climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a millionjobs across the country.&#xD;
This is where the world is going. Global consumers and investors are demanding and rewarding climate action.&#xD;
Canadians have the determination and ingenuity to rise to this challenge and global market opportunity.&#xD;
We can create good jobs today and a globally competitive economy not just next year, but in 2030, 2040, and beyond.&#xD;
Canadians also know climate change threatens our health, way of life, and planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the Government will continue to deliver.&#xD;
The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.&#xD;
As part of its plan, the Government will:&#xD;
• Create thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, cutting energy costs for Canadian families and businesses;&#xD;
• Invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters, like floods and wildfires, to make communities safer and more resilient;&#xD;
• Help deliver more transit and active transit options;&#xD;
• And make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable while investing in more charging stations across the country.&#xD;
A good example of adapting to a carbon-neutral future is building zero-emissions vehicles and batteries. Canada has the resources – from nickel to copper – needed for these clean technologies. This – combined with Canadian expertise – is Canada’s competitive edge.&#xD;
The Government will launch a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emissions products and cut the corporate tax rate in half for these companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology. The Government will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies.&#xD;
Additionally, the Government will:&#xD;
• Transform how we power our economy and communities by moving forward with the Clean Power Fund, including with projects like the Atlantic Loop that will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal;&#xD;
• And support investments in renewable energy and next-generation clean energy and technology solutions.&#xD;
Canada cannot reach net zero without the know-how of the energy sector, and the innovative ideas of all Canadians, including people in places like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Support manufacturing, natural resource, and energy sectors as they work to transform to meet a net zero future, creating good-paying and long-lasting jobs;&#xD;
• And recognize farmers, foresters, and ranchers as key partners in the fight against climate change, supporting their efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.&#xD;
The Government will continue its policy of putting a price on pollution, while putting that money back in the pockets of Canadians. It cannot be free to pollute.&#xD;
This pandemic has reminded Canadians of the importance of nature. The Government will work with municipalities as part of a new commitment to expand urban parks, so that everyone has access to green space. This will be done while protecting a quarter of Canada’s land and a quarter of Canada’s oceans in five years, and using nature-based solutions to fight climate change, including by planting two billion trees.&#xD;
The Government will ban harmful single-use plastics next year and ensure more plastic is recycled. And the Government will also modernize Canada’s Environmental Protection Act.&#xD;
When the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was closed by a previous government, Canada lost an important tool to manage its waters. The Government will create a new Canada Water Agency to keep our water safe, clean, and well-managed. The Government will also identify opportunities to build more resilient water and irrigation infrastructure.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will look at continuing to grow Canada’s ocean economy to create opportunities for fishers and coastal communities, while advancing reconciliation and conservation objectives. Investing in the Blue Economy will help Canada prosper.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="The Canada We're Fighting For" id="id-4b02b85af04544bd8260918914e22510">
      <documentation>This is a fight for Canadians today and Canada tomorrow. So we must never forget the values that make us who we are. The fourth and final foundation of the Government’s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.&#xD;
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.&#xD;
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that’s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECONCILIATION&#xD;
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.&#xD;
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.&#xD;
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:&#xD;
• Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;&#xD;
• Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action;&#xD;
• And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;&#xD;
• And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation.&#xD;
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM&#xD;
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.&#xD;
Many people – especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians – have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.&#xD;
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.&#xD;
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.&#xD;
The Government will redouble its efforts by:&#xD;
• Taking action on online hate;&#xD;
• Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;&#xD;
• Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;&#xD;
• Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;&#xD;
• And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.&#xD;
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are&#xD;
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.&#xD;
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;&#xD;
• Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;&#xD;
• Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;&#xD;
• Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;&#xD;
• And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES&#xD;
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.&#xD;
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.&#xD;
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.&#xD;
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WELCOMING CANADA&#xD;
Immigration remains a driver of Canada’s economic growth.&#xD;
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world’s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.&#xD;
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.&#xD;
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.&#xD;
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
CANADA IN THE WORLD&#xD;
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada’s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.&#xD;
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.&#xD;
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.&#xD;
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government’s plan does that as well.</documentation>

While we address climate change –&#xD;
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences –&#xD;
While we grow our economy for everyone –&#xD;
We cannot turn away from other challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.&#xD;
&#xD;
During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone should be – and feel – safe.&#xD;

      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO STAND UP FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians understand that equity, justice, and diversity are the means and the ends to living together.&#xD;

Fighting systemic racism, sexism, discrimination, misconduct, and abuse, including in our core institutions, will remain a key priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue to reform the criminal justice system and policing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to rebuild for everyone. The Government will continue to invest in the empowerment of Black and racialized Canadians, and Indigenous Peoples. It will also continue to fight harmful content online, and stand up for LGBTQ2 communities while completing the ban on conversion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Canadians, our two official languages are part of who we are.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is essential to support official language minority communities, and to protect and promote French outside and inside Quebec.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will reintroduce the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English and the Strengthening of the Official Languages Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support Canadian culture and creative industries, the Government will also reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act and ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.</documentation>

      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO MOVE FASTER ON THE PATH OF RECONCILIATION&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth. As the Government continues to respond to the Calls to Action, it will invest in that truth, including with the creation of a national monument to honour survivors, and with the appointment of a Special Interlocutor to further advance justice on residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support communities, the Government will also invest significantly in a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy, guided by Indigenous Peoples, survivors, and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone in our country deserves to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will accelerate work with Indigenous partners to address the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also make sure communities have the support they need to keep families together, while ensuring fair and equitable compensation for those harmed by the First Nations Child and Family Services program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Reconciliation requires a whole-of-government approach, breaking down barriers, and rethinking how to accelerate our work. Whether it is eliminating all remaining long-term drinking water advisories or implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Government is committed to closing the gaps that far too many First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities still face today.</documentation>

      <documentation>https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2021/12/16/minister-employment-workforce-development-and-disability-inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Minister Qualtrough:&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for continuing to serve Canadians as Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, your immediate priority is to support workers whose work has been interrupted by public health measures. I also expect you to build a better, more inclusive employment insurance system, complete and advance early and significant actions under Canada’s Disability Inclusion Action Plan, and help workers and communities prosper as we move to net-zero, including through the launch of a Clean Jobs Training Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secure passage and ensure implementation of a new Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit to support workers whose work is interrupted due to public health measures.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Health and provinces and territories to train up to 50,000 new personal support workers.&#xD;
Move forward with the design, introduction and implementation of a Canada Disability Benefit Act and Canada Disability Benefit for low-income working age persons with disabilities.&#xD;
Taking into account input received through consultations on the future of Employment Insurance (EI), by Summer 2022, bring forward and begin implementing a plan to modernize the EI system for the 21st century, building a stronger and more inclusive system that covers all workers, including workers in seasonal employment and persons employed by digital platforms, ensuring the system is simpler and more responsive for workers and employers. In addition to moving forward with extending EI sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks, the plan will include:&#xD;
A new EI benefit for self-employed Canadians that would provide unemployment assistance comparable to EI and lasting for as many as 26 weeks;&#xD;

Launching an employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;&#xD;
Undertaking a comprehensive review of access to federal disability programs, including for Canadians with mental health challenges;&#xD;
Supporting national disability organizations to build capacity and partner in efforts to eliminate systemic barriers;&#xD;
Advancing our commitment to permanently fund support services that ensure equitable access to reading and other published works for Canadians with print disabilities; and&#xD;
Proceeding with the implementation of the Accessible Canada Act and the harmonization of accessibility standards across Canada.&#xD;
Permanently eliminate federal interest on Canada Student Loans and Canada Apprentice Loans, increase the repayment assistance threshold to $50,000 for Canada Student Loan borrowers who are single and make appropriate adjustments to the thresholds for other family sizes, and allow new parents to pause repayment of their federal student loans until their youngest child reaches the age of five.&#xD;
Increase by 50 per cent the maximum debt forgiveness for which family doctors, residents in family medicine, nurse practitioners and nurses who work in rural or remote areas are eligible under the Canada Student Loans Forgiveness program, expand the current list of eligible professionals and undertake a review to ensure that rural communities are fully eligible in order to improve access to health care and social services in rural communities.&#xD;
To support the future and livelihood of workers and their communities in the transition to a low carbon economy:&#xD;

Continue to support the work of the national campaign to promote the skilled trades as first choice careers for young people and diverse populations.&#xD;
With the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, establish a Trusted Employer system for Canadian companies hiring temporary foreign workers and, as part of improving the Global Talent Stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, simplify permit renewals, uphold the two-week processing time and establish an employer hotline. Continue to work with provinces, territories and regulatory bodies to improve foreign credential recognition.&#xD;
With the support of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, implement sector-based work permits and strengthen the inspection regime to ensure the health and safety of temporary foreign workers.&#xD;
Support the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food in developing a sector-specific Agricultural Labour Strategy to address persistent and chronic labour shortages in farming and food processing in the short and long term.&#xD;
Make it easier for women and vulnerable groups to access training by requiring businesses supported through the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program to include wrap-around supports.&#xD;
Support the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth in the evaluation process of GBA Plus with the goal of enhancing the framing and parameters of this analytical tool, and with particular attention to the intersectional analysis of race, indigeneity, rurality, disability and sexual identity, among other characteristics.&#xD;
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.&#xD;

&#xD;
Dear Minister Gould:&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for agreeing to serve Canadians as Minister of Families, Children and Social Development.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, your immediate priority is to build a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system that reduces parent fees, creates more high-quality spaces, recruits and retains skilled educators, and ensures all kids get off to the best possible start. At the same time, you will work with Indigenous partners to implement a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system. You will also focus on implementing the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as well as ensure Service Canada provides reliable and accessible services to Canadians, regardless of where they live. &#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supported by the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, continue advancing the creation and sustainability of a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system, including:&#xD;
Concluding negotiations with remaining provinces and territories and implementing agreements:&#xD;
Reducing fees for regulated child care by 50 per cent on average by the end of 2022 everywhere outside of Quebec,&#xD;
Reducing regulated child care fees to $10 a day on average by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026 everywhere outside of Quebec, and&#xD;
Building 250,000 new high-quality child care spaces and hiring 40,000 more early childhood educators by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026;&#xD;
Introducing federal child care legislation to strengthen and protect a high-quality Canada-wide child care system; &#xD;
Establishing a National Advisory Council on Early Learning and Child Care;&#xD;
Continuing to advance work with provinces and territories to reduce fees for families for before and after school care; and&#xD;
Ensuring the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care is fully resourced and operational by early 2023.&#xD;
Work with Indigenous partners to ensure that Indigenous children have access to a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system that meets the needs of Indigenous families wherever they live, including ensuring more Indigenous families have access to high-quality programming, creating 3,300 new child care spaces, and continuing to support before and after school care for First Nations children on reserve.&#xD;
Advance the implementation of the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as they recover from the pandemic.&#xD;
Continue advancing the Social Innovation and Social Finance strategy, including fully implementing the Social Finance Fund and launching the Social Innovation Advisory Council.&#xD;
Through the delivery of Canada’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and other measures, continue leading implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and with provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous partners and stakeholders to develop a National School Food Policy and to work toward a national school nutritious meal program.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Seniors to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.&#xD;
As the Minister responsible for Service Canada, lead the development and implementation of modern, resilient, secure and reliable services and benefit delivery systems for Canadians and ensure those services and benefits reach all Canadians regardless of where they live.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of National Revenue toward the implementation of a real-time e-payroll system, and ensure that businesses of all sizes benefit from this work.&#xD;
Enhance the capacity and effectiveness of Black-led and Black-serving organizations through the continued implementation of the Supporting Black Canadian Communities Initiative. You will be supported in this work by the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion.&#xD;
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure the voices and needs of children are represented in our Government’s agenda, as we work to make Canada the best place to grow up.&#xD;
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as they recover from the impact of the pandemic.&#xD;
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making.

As Minister of Labour, your immediate priorities are to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccinations are enforced for those workers and to advance amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 paid days of sick leave for all federally regulated workers. I also expect you to work with federally regulated employers and labour groups, and with provincial and territorial counterparts, to make workplaces fairer and safer for everyone across the country as well as lead our efforts to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continue to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccination is enforced.&#xD;
Secure passage of amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 days of paid sick leave for all federally regulated workers, and convene provinces and territories to develop a national action plan to legislate sick leave across the country while respecting provincial-territorial jurisdiction and the unique needs of small business owners.&#xD;

Work with the Minister of Natural Resources in moving forward with legislation and comprehensive action to achieve a Just Transition.

I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Seniors, your immediate priority is to support and help advance the Government’s commitment to increase Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. I also expect you to support the Minister of Health in improving the quality and availability of long-term care and to take concrete actions to support seniors who want to age at home. As well, you will continue to create opportunities for seniors to be more connected, supported, and active members of their communities through implementing the New Horizons for Seniors Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building on our commitment to old age security, increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement by $500 for single seniors and $750 for couples starting at age 65.&#xD;
Ensure seniors’ eligibility for the Guaranteed Income Supplement is not negatively impacted by receipt of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB).&#xD;
Establish an expert panel to provide recommendations for establishing an Aging at Home Benefit. You will be supported by the Minister of Health in this work.&#xD;
Assist community-based organizations in providing practical support that helps low-income and otherwise vulnerable seniors age in place, and support regional and national projects that help expand services that have already demonstrated results in helping seniors stay in their homes.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.&#xD;
Continue to work with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to strengthen Canada’s approach to elder abuse by finalizing the national definition of elder abuse, investing in better data collection and establishing new offences and penalties in the Criminal Code related to elder abuse.&#xD;
Represent the Government of Canada at the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Seniors Forum.&#xD;
Continue leading work within Employment and Social Development Canada on seniors’ programming including the New Horizons for Seniors Program.&#xD;
Support the Minister of Health in their work to improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes and beds. This includes working with provinces and territories to improve infection prevention and control measures, identify shared principles, and develop national standards to ensure seniors get the care they deserve.&#xD;
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely,&#xD;
&#xD;

      <documentation>https://pm.gc.ca/fr/lettres-de-mandat/2021/12/16/lettre-de-mandat-de-la-ministre-de-lemploi-du-developpement-de-la-main&#xD;
&#xD;
Madame la Ministre,&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous remercie de continuer de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.&#xD;
&#xD;
En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.&#xD;
&#xD;
La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tant que ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir les travailleurs dont le travail a été interrompu par des mesures de santé publique. Je m’attends à ce que vous mettiez en place un meilleur système d’assurance-emploi qui soit plus inclusif, à ce que vous meniez à bien et fassiez progresser les premières mesures importantes prévues dans le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, et à ce que vous aidiez les travailleurs et les collectivités à prospérer au moment où nous passons à la carboneutralité, notamment par le lancement d’un centre de formation pour les emplois propres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Travailler à l’adoption et à la mise en œuvre d’une nouvelle Prestation canadienne pour les travailleurs en cas de confinement pour soutenir les travailleurs touchés par une interruption de travail découlant des mesures de santé publique.&#xD;
Travailler avec le ministre de la Santé, les provinces et les territoires afin de faire former jusqu’à 50 000 nouveaux préposés aux services de soutien à la personne.&#xD;

En plus de prévoir le prolongement des prestations de maladie (de 15 à 26 semaines), le plan comprend :&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-emploi pour les travailleurs autonomes canadiens, qui fournirait un soutien en cas de chômage comparable à celui qu’offre l’assurance-emploi pouvant s’étendre sur 26 semaines;&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation de 15 semaines pour les parents adoptifs;&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-carrière pour offrir aux travailleurs de longue date qui ont perdu leur emploi un revenu d’emploi additionnel pendant qu’ils tentent de réintégrer le marché du travail;&#xD;
la prise en compte des réalités des artistes et des travailleurs du secteur de la culture.&#xD;
Finaliser et rendre public le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, en consultation avec la communauté des personnes en situation de handicap. Ce Plan comprend des mesures immédiates dans des secteurs importants comme la sécurité financière et l’emploi et prévoit la création d’espaces inclusifs pour les personnes en situation de handicap et l’adoption d’une approche moderne et d’une définition commune à l’égard de l’invalidité dans l’ensemble du gouvernement du Canada. En plus des mesures qui seront instaurées par d’autres ministres, les mesures à prendre comprennent les suivantes :&#xD;
Mettre en œuvre une stratégie d’emploi pour les Canadiens en situation de handicap;&#xD;
Entreprendre un examen complet de l’accès aux programmes d’invalidité fédéraux, notamment pour les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale;&#xD;

Éliminer définitivement les intérêts sur les prêts d’études canadiens et les prêts canadiens aux apprentis. Faire passer à 50 000 $ le seuil du Programme d’aide au remboursement pour les étudiants emprunteurs qui sont célibataires et apporter les modifications appropriées aux seuils pour les familles de diverses tailles. Et permettre aux nouveaux parents de suspendre le remboursement de leurs prêts étudiants jusqu’à ce que leur plus jeune enfant ait cinq ans.&#xD;
Faire passer à 50 % l’effacement maximal de la dette auquel les médecins de famille, les résidents en médecine familiale, les infirmiers praticiens ou les infirmiers travaillant en régions rurales ou éloignées sont admissibles en vertu du Programme canadien de dispense de remboursement des prêts d’études. Élargir la liste actuelle des professionnels. Et entreprendre un examen pour s’assurer que les communautés rurales sont pleinement admissibles au programme afin d’améliorer l’accès aux soins de santé et aux services sociaux dans ces communautés.&#xD;
Pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone :&#xD;
Aider le ministre des Ressources naturelles et le ministre du Travail à favoriser l'adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires;&#xD;
Lancer un Centre de formation pour les emplois propres afin d’aider les travailleurs de tous les secteurs à mettre à niveau leurs compétences ou à en acquérir de nouvelles pour être à la fine pointe de l’industrie du carbone à zéro émission;&#xD;

Combler les lacunes en matière de formation et de perfectionnement afin que tous les travailleurs canadiens puissent profiter des débouchés durables offerts par l’industrie des batteries.&#xD;
Doubler le financement du Programme pour la formation et l’innovation en milieu syndical pour financer davantage de possibilités de formation en apprentissage et davantage de partenariats concernant les métiers du Sceau rouge partout au Canada, et pour accroître la participation de populations plus diverses, notamment des femmes, des Autochtones, des nouveaux arrivants, des personnes en situation de handicap, des Noirs et des Canadiens racisés. Continuer à faire la promotion du Service canadien d’apprentissage en partenariat avec les provinces, les territoires, les employeurs et les syndicats pour que les apprentis du Sceau rouge aient suffisamment d’occasions d’acquérir de l’expérience professionnelle, notamment auprès de petits et moyens employeurs, pour terminer leur formation à temps et trouver des emplois bien rémunérés.&#xD;
Continuer à soutenir le travail de la campagne nationale visant à promouvoir les métiers spécialisés comme des carrières de premier choix pour les jeunes et les populations diverses.&#xD;
Avec le ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté, établir un système d’employeur de confiance pour les entreprises canadiennes embauchant des travailleurs étrangers temporaires et, dans cadre de l’amélioration du Volet des talents mondiaux du Programme des travailleurs étrangers temporaires, simplifier le renouvellement des permis, faire respecter le délai de traitement de deux semaines et créer une ligne d’assistance pour les employeurs. Continuer de travailler avec les provinces, les territoires et les organismes de réglementation pour améliorer la reconnaissance des titres de compétences étrangers.&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire, mettre en œuvre des permis de travail sectoriels et renforcer le régime d’inspection pour assurer la santé et la sécurité des travailleurs étrangers temporaires.&#xD;
Aider la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire à élaborer une stratégie en matière de main-d’œuvre dans le secteur agricole pour combler les pénuries de main-d’œuvre chroniques et persistantes dans les secteurs de l’agriculture et de la transformation des aliments à court et long terme.&#xD;
Faciliter l’accès des femmes et des membres de groupes vulnérables à la formation en exigeant des entreprises bénéficiant du Programme de solutions pour la main-d’œuvre sectorielle qu’elles prévoient des mesures de soutien globales.&#xD;
Appuyer la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse dans le processus d’évaluation de l’ACS Plus afin d’améliorer le cadre et les paramètres de cet outil d’analyse, en portant une attention particulière à l’analyse intersectionnelle de diverses caractéristiques, parmi lesquelles l’ethnicité, l’identité autochtone, la ruralité, les handicaps et l’identité sexuelle.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député&#xD;

En tant que ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social, votre priorité immédiate est de mettre en place un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants qui permettra de réduire les frais exigés des parents, de créer plus de places de qualité, de recruter et de retenir des éducateurs qualifiés ainsi que de faire en sorte que tous les enfants bénéficient du meilleur départ possible dans la vie. Parallèlement, vous travaillerez avec des partenaires autochtones pour mettre en place un système d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants adapté à la culture autochtone. Par ailleurs, vous vous concentrerez sur la mise en œuvre du Fonds de relance des services communautaires afin d’aider les organismes de bienfaisance et les organismes sans but lucratif à s’adapter et à se moderniser, et vous veillerez à ce que Service Canada fournisse des services fiables et accessibles aux Canadiens, peu importe où ils vivent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, continuer à promouvoir la création et la durabilité d’un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants, en prenant les mesures suivantes :&#xD;
Conclure les négociations avec les provinces et territoires restants, et mettre en œuvre des ententes :&#xD;
Réduire de moitié en moyenne les frais des services de garde d’enfants réglementés d’ici la fin de 2022 partout au Canada à l’extérieur du Québec;&#xD;
Abaisser à 10 $ par jour en moyenne les frais de services de garde d’enfants réglementés d’ici la fin de l’exercice 2025-2026 partout au Canada à l’extérieur du Québec;&#xD;

Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons.

&#xD;
Monsieur le Ministre,&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous remercie d’avoir accepté de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre du Travail.&#xD;
&#xD;
Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.&#xD;
&#xD;
En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.&#xD;
&#xD;
La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tant que ministre du Travail, vos priorités immédiates sont de collaborer avec les milieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination contre la COVID-19 y soit obligatoire, et de modifier le Code canadien du travail de sorte que tous les travailleurs régis par les lois fédérales aient droit à 10 jours de congés de maladie payés. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les organisations représentant les travailleurs, ainsi qu’avec vos homologues provinciaux et territoriaux, pour rendre les lieux de travail plus sécuritaires et équitables pour toutes les personnes à l’échelle du pays et à ce que vous chapeautiez nos efforts visant à éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Poursuivre la collaboration avec les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 soit mise en œuvre.&#xD;
Obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail pour accorder 10 jours de congé de maladie payés à tous les travailleurs sous réglementation fédérale, et convoquer les provinces et les territoires pour élaborer un plan d’action national dans le but de légiférer les congés de maladie dans tout le pays, tout en respectant les compétences provinciales et territoriales et les besoins uniques des propriétaires de petites entreprises.&#xD;
Terminer l’élaboration d’une politique de droit de se déconnecter, de concert avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les groupes syndicaux.&#xD;
Aller de l’avant et obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail afin d’inclure la santé mentale en tant qu’élément particulier des normes de santé et de sécurité au travail et d’exiger des employeurs sous réglementation fédérale qu’ils prennent des mesures préventives visant à résoudre les problèmes de stress et les risques de blessures au travail.&#xD;
Modifier le Code canadien du travail afin de prévoir jusqu’à cinq jours de congé payés de plus pour les employés sous réglementation fédérale qui vivent une situation de fausse couche ou de mort à la naissance, et de renforcer les dispositions visant à mieux soutenir les travailleuses qui doivent être réaffectées pendant la grossesse et l’allaitement.&#xD;
Continuer à travailler avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux pour mettre pleinement en œuvre la Convention sur la violence et le harcèlement de 2019 de l’Organisation internationale du Travail et continuer à appuyer les employeurs et les syndicats pour renforcer les mesures de prévention du harcèlement et de la violence dans les lieux de travail de compétence fédérale.&#xD;
Diriger les efforts pour fournir des produits d’hygiène féminine gratuits dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale afin de favoriser la participation des femmes au travail.&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la présidente du Conseil du Trésor, du ministre du Logement et de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion et de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, travailler à accélérer l’examen de la Loi sur l’équité en matière d’emploi et assurer la mise en œuvre rapide des améliorations nécessaires.&#xD;
Moderniser le Programme de contrats fédéraux pour veiller à ce que les entrepreneurs fédéraux paient à leurs employés le salaire minimum fédéral, de façon à respecter les engagements relatifs au leadership sur les plans environnemental, social et de la gouvernance et à l’approvisionnement du gouvernement.&#xD;
Continuer à faire progresser la mise en œuvre de la Loi sur l’équité salariale dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale.&#xD;
Créer un processus de négociation collective plus équitable dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale en faisant avancer des mesures législatives qui interdisent le recours à des travailleurs de remplacement lorsqu’un employeur syndiqué met ses employés en lock-out.&#xD;
Appuyer la vice-première ministre et ministre des Finances dans l’introduction d’un crédit d’impôt pour la mobilité de la main-d’œuvre permettant aux travailleurs des secteurs du bâtiment et de la construction de déduire les frais admissibles de déplacement et de réinstallation temporaire.&#xD;
Travailler avec le ministre des Ressources naturelles pour favoriser l’adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone. Vous recevrez l’appui de la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap et des ministres responsables des agences de développement régional.&#xD;
Travailler à des modifications qui permettront aux travailleurs à l’emploi de grandes plateformes numériques de bénéficier d’une sécurité d’emploi en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Vous collaborerez également avec la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap pour veiller à ce que ces travailleurs bénéficient de prestations et de mesures de soutien.&#xD;
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Sécurité publique, de la ministre des Services publics et de l’Approvisionnement et de la ministre du Commerce international, de la Promotion des exportations, de la Petite Entreprise et du Développement économique, présenter un projet de loi pour éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes et faire en sorte que les entreprises canadiennes qui mènent des activités à l’étranger ne contribuent pas à des violations des droits de la personne.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;

En tant que ministre des Aînés, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir et de faire progresser l’engagement pris par le gouvernement d’augmenter la Sécurité de la vieillesse et le Supplément de revenu garanti. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des soins de longue durée, et à prendre des mesures concrètes pour soutenir les aînés qui veulent vieillir chez eux. De plus, vous continuerez de créer des possibilités pour les aînés d’entretenir plus de liens, d’obtenir du soutien et d’être des membres actifs de leur communauté en mettant en œuvre le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tablant sur notre engagement à l’égard de la Sécurité de la vieillesse, augmenter le Supplément de revenu garanti de 500 $ pour les aînés vivant seuls et de 750 $ pour les couples, à compter de l’âge de 65 ans.&#xD;
Veiller à ce que la Prestation canadienne d’urgence (PCU) et la Prestation canadienne de la relance économique (PCRE) n’aient pas d’incidence négative sur l’admissibilité des aînés au Supplément de revenu garanti.&#xD;
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Santé, créer un comité d’experts chargé de formuler des recommandations sur la mise en œuvre d’une allocation Vieillir chez soi.&#xD;
Aider les organismes communautaires à fournir un soutien pratique pour aider les aînés à faibles revenus ou autrement vulnérables à vivre chez eux aussi longtemps que possible, et appuyer les projets régionaux et nationaux qui facilitent l’expansion de services ayant déjà fait leurs preuves pour ce qui est d’aider les aînés à demeurer dans leur domicile.&#xD;
Travailler avec la ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social pour fournir aux aînés un point d’accès unique à un vaste éventail de services et de prestations du gouvernement.&#xD;
Continuer de collaborer avec le ministre de la Justice et procureur général du Canada pour renforcer l’approche du Canada à l’égard de la maltraitance des personnes âgées en mettant la dernière main à la définition nationale des mauvais traitements infligés aux aînés, en investissant des fonds pour améliorer la collecte de données, et en établissant dans le Code criminel de nouvelles infractions et de nouvelles sanctions liées à la maltraitance des aînés.&#xD;
Représenter le gouvernement du Canada au Forum des ministres fédéral, provinciaux et territoriaux responsables des aînés.&#xD;
Continuer de diriger les travaux d’Emploi et Développement social Canada portant sur les programmes destinés aux aînés, ce qui comprend le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.&#xD;
Aider le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des établissements et des lits de soins de longue durée. Pour ce faire, travailler avec les provinces et territoires pour améliorer les mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections, définir les principes communs et élaborer des normes nationales afin que les aînés reçoivent les soins qu’ils méritent.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député&#xD;
Premier ministre du Canada&#xD;

      <documentation>Employment and Social Development Canada’s Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is the largest information technology project undertaken to date by the federal government. The programme had 2 key goals:&#xD;
• migrate Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, and Canada Pension Plan benefits to a modern cloud‑based platform&#xD;
• transform benefits delivery and the user experience to meet the needs of diverse groups, including seniors, people in remote locations, Indigenous peoples, and refugees&#xD;
The information technology systems currently used to deliver these benefits to Canadians are between 20 and 60 years old and at risk of failing. If these systems were to fail, it could greatly affect the more than 10 million Canadians who rely on them to meet their daily needs.&#xD;
We found that in the face of ongoing delays, cost increases, and staffing challenges, the department showed flexibility by adjusting its approach from working on both of the programme’s goals in tandem to prioritizing the migration of the aging systems to reduce the risk of system failure. However, this approach meant delaying the programme’s much‑needed transformation component, which is intended to improve how people access and receive these benefits, including reducing the occurrence of inaccurate payments. The programme is more than halfway into its initially planned timeline, and all 3 benefits are still operating on outdated systems with limitations.&#xD;
As time goes on and estimated costs continue to rise, we are concerned that decision makers may scale back or eliminate the transformation component of the 3 benefits, resulting in a final product that does not consider the needs of millions of Canadians who rely on them. The Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is an opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate how it could improve the planning and execution of large, multi‑year information technology projects.</documentation>

      <documentation>2.2.3 Program Alignment Architecture&#xD;
There are gaps in Canada’s social safety net and poverty among working-age persons with disabilities remains higher than those without disabilities. Building a more accessible Canada remains a top priority for the Government of Canada. At the centre of this work will be re-introducing legislation to create the Canada Disability Benefit, which would significantly reduce poverty in Canada and help ensure that working-age Canadians with disabilities live in dignity. Alongside this work, ESDC will continue to develop and implement the Disability Inclusion Action Plan and work toward the Accessible Canada Act goal of a barrier-free Canada by 2040.&#xD;
&#xD;
As per ESDC Departmental Results Framework 2023-24, CDB fits into ESDC core responsibility number 2 : Pensions and Benefits, as it aims to ensure that Persons with disabilities and their families have financial support.</documentation>

      <documentation>More than 6.2 million Canadians, including just over 4 million who are working-age (18-64), identify as having a disability, and approximately 1.6 million working-age Canadians have a severe or very severe disability. According to the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability (CSD), 917,000 working-age Canadians with disabilities experience poverty—twice the rate of their peers without disabilities (23% vs 12% based on Canada's Official Poverty Line, the Market Basket Measure (MBM)). The poverty rate increases with severity of disability, with 28% of persons with severe disabilities and 34% of persons with very severe disabilities living in poverty. Of those, 60% of persons with disabilities live in deep poverty (incomes below 75% of the MBM threshold). While this precarious financial situation is a long-term, ongoing, structural issue, it is only worsened in periods of financial stress (such as the current period of high inflation), which can push those already living on the edge deeper into poverty.</documentation>

      <documentation>The financial situation of working-age persons with disabilities improves significantly when they become eligible for Old Age Security/Guaranteed Income Supplement (OAS / GIS) – the rate of poverty drops from 23% for working-age persons with disabilities to 9% for those 65 years of age and older (2017 CSD). In contrast, for most working-age persons with disabilities who do not qualify for Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPPD) due to no or little labor market attachment, there are no federal supports beyond tax measures and long-term savings vehicles. P/T supports (which are income programs of last resort) are largely insufficient to lift persons with disabilities out of poverty. This is why the CDB aims to supplement rather than replace existing benefits. Given differences in eligibility and other criteria across P/T disability programs, supplementation will differ across P/Ts. With time, the CDB may stand alongside other statutory income supports as a foundational piece of Canada's social support system.</documentation>

      <documentation>Priority 1: Central AI capacity&#xD;
A common theme heard from government departments during consultations was a need for a central hub to support project implementation and share knowledge. AI accelerators or specialist technical teams able to support project teams with technical development are increasingly being established within departments. However, there is an unmet need for guidance on many other aspects of AI implementation. These include identifying use cases, evaluating data readiness, assessing risk, determining whether to build or buy solutions, and navigating assessment, governance, and procurement processes. Departments also commonly expressed a need for a convenor to share knowledge, code, scalable tools, and lessons learned from departmental experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: AI Accelerators in the Government of Canada&#xD;
Over the past decade, more and more Government of Canada departments have established their own AI accelerators or centres of expertise to promote departmental adoption. Some examples of these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
National Research Council’s (NRC) AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs&#xD;
The NRC has promoted AI adoption across federal departments and agencies through its AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs, completing over 100 projects in the past five years. These initiatives span national security, digital privacy, digital health, scientific discovery, logistics, geospatial analytics, and Indigenous languages, improving public services, productivity, and situational awareness. With over 110 AI specialists and access to advanced computation facilities and global partnerships, the NRC supports and enhances AI initiatives across the Government of Canada, driving innovation and adoption for a more secure and technologically advanced nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shared Services Canada’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Program and AI Centre of Excellence (AICoE)&#xD;
The AI Program and the AICoE Incubate AI use cases, promote the use of AI, break down silos and foster digital innovation. Established in 2019, the AI Program has incubated more than 15 use cases, including CANChat. The AI CoE supports Government of Canada exploration of AI and intelligent automation, providing a central repository for sharing best practices, training materials, and strategic guidance. It convenes AI and intelligent automation working groups to explore challenges and identify opportunities and solutions to accelerate responsible adoption. The AI CoE also provides guidance to departments embarking on AI adoption and contributes to Algorithmic Impact Assessment peer review and the development of policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Natural Resources Canada's Digital Accelerator&#xD;
NRCan works with scientists, economists and researchers to pilot advanced solutions and tools, including AI, strengthen digital expertise and literacy in the department and sector, and future-proof the department and its partners. Its projects include platforms or tools for accelerated materials discovery, mineral detection, industrial systems performance optimization, and grid optimization for electric vehicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Establish an AI Centre of Expertise for the Government of Canada&#xD;
The AI Centre of Expertise (AI CoE) will complement services offered by existing accelerators and centres, focusing on project support, knowledge sharing, and strategic guidance to support AI adoption and experimentation. It will provide project guidance, advise on common processes, and share best practice, experience, knowledge and code. It will also encourage interdepartmental or whole-of-government collaboration on solutions for common needs. The AI CoE will help business teams to:&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify high-value use cases for AI integration. This may include helping departments evaluate factors like task and data suitability; infrastructure, model, and data requirements and limitations; cost/benefit analysis; privacy, accessibility, environmental, and equity considerations; risk identification, evaluation, and mitigation; workforce impacts; and how to evaluate project success against objectives.&#xD;
Support data readiness: This would include supporting the implementation of the 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service as a critical enabler for AI adoption. The AI CoE could advise departments on preparing their data for AI use or training and identifying Government of Canada datasets that could be combined to enable AI.&#xD;
Support with procurement, governance, assessments, review processes, and other requirements. This would include providing guidance on options for procurement; algorithmic, accessibility, language, privacy, and environmental impact assessments; transparency, reporting, ethics, bias, peer review, GBA Plus analysis, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty requirements; securing AI and understanding risks; and processes for explanation and recourse. It will also include providing input into the development of a governance framework (see Priority 2) and the creation of standard language to inform vendors of their role in responsible AI adoption.&#xD;
In addition to supporting project teams, the AI CoE will act as:&#xD;
&#xD;
A convenor for government-wide knowledge sharing. It will share successful initiatives to prevent duplication of effort, maximize return on investment, and promote awareness and adoption of existing approved solutions. This will include sharing government-developed code and solutions, project documentation, information, policy, and instruments; soliciting feedback, use cases, and lessons learned from departments; and encouraging the scaling of successful projects. It will also work with the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) to identify and promote training priorities and provide input into new policy or procurement vehicles.&#xD;
An accelerator for AI solutions to meet common Government of Canada needs. Working with departments, the AI CoE will identify potential solutions that meet government-wide needs that could be broadly scaled and support their development.&#xD;
A monitor of progress on AI adoption. The AI CoE will develop frameworks for progress and impact of Government of Canada AI adoption that can be used to benchmark, monitor, and report on the progress and compliance with policy and standards.&#xD;
Enable common infrastructure&#xD;
The Government of Canada and departments will ensure the provision of common infrastructure to enable AI adoption and will promote the adoption of existing approved enterprise solutions. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructure that is available, secure, and scalable to meet the demands of AI projects. &#xD;
common data and information management systems and practices to support sharing, scaling, and agentic capabilities across Government of Canada platforms.&#xD;
access to approved models, services, and application programming interfaces (APIs) within common Government of Canada cloud platforms to build or deploy systems.&#xD;
access to common AI solutions and capabilities in vendor solutions through a standard Government of Canada platform service.&#xD;
Where possible, they will support Canadian suppliers and vendors in order to promote the growth of the Canadian AI industry and ensure secure sovereign infrastructure and solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify and develop a lighthouse project&#xD;
This project will be either a new initiative or one currently at pilot stage that would meet an enterprise-wide need and could be readily scaled. Its development, testing, and delivery will be undertaken collaboratively by the AI CoE and lead department. It will serve as:&#xD;
&#xD;
A test case to identify barriers and project teams’ needs for support during development and obstacles to subsequent customization and scaling.&#xD;
A pilot for the development of government-wide governance processes (see Priority 2 ).&#xD;
An opportunity to develop templates and examples of project documentation.&#xD;
A demonstration of the value of AI use cases.&#xD;
Learn more about: The lighthouse project&#xD;
The Strategy proposes the development of a lighthouse project that would both meet an enterprise-wide need and provide an opportunity to develop and test Government of Canada governance and support processes for AI adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
As its first lighthouse project, TBS will work with the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to scale its self-serve language hub pilot across the Government of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Translation Bureau has developed a self-serve language hub pilot to provide PSPC employees with access to a variety of secure, real-time AI-driven language tools, trained with Canadian data. These include automated translation tools that can be used to provide instant translations of low-risk and low-value documents. The service operates in a secure cloud up to Protected B, with all data centralized within the Bureau and housed in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
For users, this would provide a secure and approved one-stop shop for linguistic needs. For the Government, availability of an approved automated tool would reduce translation costs without compromising data security or sovereignty or product quality. Use of the Translation Bureau’s repository of 8 billion words (2 TB) to train the model would ensure a high level of consistency, quality, and customization to the specificities of Canadian culture, identity and realities.</documentation>

      <documentation>Priority 2: Policy, legislation, and governance&#xD;
Responsible AI adoption needs clear, up-to-date legislation and policy. Together, they mark out not only the necessary guardrails for identifying and mitigating risk, but also the space within which developers are free to experiment and innovate. Clear legislation and policy help to build public trust, overcome institutional resistance to AI innovation and enable governments to move further and faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
As in many jurisdictions, some Canadian legislation and federal policy has not been revised for the AI era. Some law or policy is silent on areas needed to govern AI, while others may introduce unintended bias in data collection or obstruct AI adoption unnecessarily and unintentionally. Incremental development has created a patchwork of policies that are difficult for AI project teams to understand and navigate, and no common model for AI governance yet exists within the Government of Canada. These challenges must be addressed to build public confidence in the Government of Canada’s ability to deliver AI-enabled services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: AI-ready law and policy&#xD;
Policy, law, and regulations must support the use of AI and must be kept updated to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as technology evolves.  In response, the Government of Canada and leading jurisdictions worldwide have begun to incorporate commitments to scheduled review cycles into key laws and policy instruments, a new best practice that should be more widely adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government of Canada’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making and associated Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool are reviewed every two years. &#xD;
Amendments made in 2019 to the Access to Information Act include a 5-year review cycle.&#xD;
The EU AI Act includes provisions for an annual review of both its list of high-risk AI systems and the AI practices it prohibits.&#xD;
Even without a specified review cycle, other jurisdictions regularly review and amend key legislation and policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
Australia has conducted regular reviews of its Privacy Act 1988 to address emerging privacy issues and technological developments, with four major reviews since its enactment.&#xD;
The EU regularly reviews its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other technology-related laws to adapt to new technological advancements and challenges.&#xD;
Lastly, some jurisdictions have developed guidance to ensure that all new legislation supports new technologies by design.&#xD;
&#xD;
Denmark’s digital-ready legislation program has established mandatory assessment against seven principles for digitally-ready legislation to ensure that new laws and regulations are compatible with digital technologies and can be efficiently administered using digital tools.&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Establish common AI governance and risk management frameworks&#xD;
Drawing on international and Government of Canada best practice, the Government of Canada will establish common governance and risk management frameworks for the AI lifecycle to provide clear guidance to AI project teams. These frameworks will balance risk with the pace required for innovation; be scaled to system risk, sensitivity, and impact; and will be designed to adapt as technology changes. They will address potential risks associated with AI use, such as data privacy and security, bias detection and mitigation, model interpretability and explainability, environmental impact, and human involvement. The frameworks will incorporate Canadian requirements, such as the need to advance Indigenous Data Sovereignty and provide technologies in both official languages. They will also lay out the security, trust, and reliability controls necessary to ensure the continued maintenance and resilience of these systems, including system shutdown measures to respond to emergencies. This work will support ongoing efforts to harmonize data standards, increase interoperability, and support other enablers.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, it will include a government-wide governance structure responsible for implementing the governance framework. This will include an AI ethics review board responsible for providing guidance on responsible AI and for evaluating higher risk and impact projects at key stages of the project lifecycle. The governance structure will make use of existing Government of Canada governance bodies and organizations such as the Canada AI Safety Institute wherever possible. In addition to providing project governance, these bodies and organizations will help identify high-value AI use cases, regularly reprioritize the AI Strategy's actions, and prioritize and oversee the AI Strategy's implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Address policy and legislative alignment, gaps, and barriers&#xD;
The Government of Canada will review and propose changes to instruments that create unnecessary obstacles to AI adoption. It will fill identified policy gaps, such as clarifying the responsibilities of chief information, data and privacy officers for AI adoption, and the acceptable use of AI by outside organizations in their interactions with the Government of Canada. It will also address legal and policy ambiguities related to privacy and training data and the application of the national security exemption. The Government of Canada will update procurement policies, instruments and processes to make them more responsive to pace and requirements of AI procurement. It will also consider ways in which the Government of Canada can better align internal AI policy with the Pan Canadian AI Strategy to support the Canadian AI sector, with the United Nations Declaration Act commitments to Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and with international treaties, legislation and norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work will lead to the development of clear and concrete commitments to revise specific instruments within a set timeline, and an agile process to review and update policy, guidance, tools and resources to respond to technological, legislative and social change. The Government of Canada will also review the policy landscape for opportunities to synthesize or interpret existing policy to increase usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopt a “think AI” approach&#xD;
The Government of Canada will optimize its AI adoption by embedding a “think AI” approach to its policies, programs and services. The intent is not to adopt AI at all costs or in contexts where its use would not be responsible or useful. Rather, the goal is to challenge departments to identify key business problems that could be transformed using AI, consider AI options before defaulting to traditional IT or HR approaches, and make planned investments in AI and its enablers.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support this, the Government of Canada will require departments to:&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify three areas, programs or services with business problems that have a high potential to be solved using AI.&#xD;
Consider solutions and resourcing requirements for AI and its enablers at the outset of initiatives. This will include changes to Treasury Board submissions, Memoranda to Cabinet, and budget and off-cycle funding proposals to incorporate data, AI, compute, and other relevant requirements.&#xD;
Prioritize AI infrastructure and secure adoption in departmental integrated IT planning processes.&#xD;
Develop their own AI strategies to ensure alignment and effective use of resources.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="Priority 3: Talent and training (Value)" id="id-3db2193f082f47888beda2e3603503bc">
      <documentation>Priority 3: Talent and training&#xD;
To adopt AI responsibly, we need people with the right technical and non-technical skills. Although Canada is a global leader in AI research, demand for AI skills significantly outpaces supply. Within the Government of Canada, there is a 30% vacancy rate for digital roles, threatening delivery and leading to a costly dependence on external contractors. As it plans for increased AI adoption, the Government of Canada must consider how it will meet its AI talent needs through training, upskilling, and recruitment so that it can optimize its use of AI to serve Canadians better.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Develop a training plan&#xD;
Building on existing offerings from CSPS, the Government of Canada will develop a training plan for existing public servants. The developed training plan will be evergreen to match the pace of AI development. Through this plan, the Government of Canada will consider ways that AI may reshape the workforce, working with employees and their bargaining agents to prepare public servants for this change through retraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
The training plan will incorporate both general training and training tailored to specific personas with varying roles, levels and responsibilities. The general training will be directed at increasing understanding of and confidence in using AI, including embedded AI capabilities; developing skills associated with responsible, secure, and effective use, including effective prompt engineering; and establishing leadership programs to achieve a culture that promotes AI adoption. The tailored training will address both more specific and advanced technical skills, and the behavioural skills needed for successful adoption, such risk identification and management, and effective leadership of AI projects and teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
Benchmark talent needs&#xD;
The Government of Canada will benchmark both talent requirements for AI and its employees’ existing AI knowledge and skills across the enterprise. These benchmarks will enable the development of learner personas with accompanying training plans and identify employees who could be offered further training.&#xD;
&#xD;
Develop a talent plan&#xD;
Since not all talent needs can be met through training, the Government of Canada will need to develop a plan to recruit and retain talent. This plan will explore obstacles to recruitment and retention and ways to establish flexible data science career pathways for AI practitioners. It will also consider ways to expand interchanges, apprenticeships, co-op programs, and partnerships with AI institutes and research centres to create a talent pipeline. It will consider ways to make efficient use of AI talent through flexible assignments, and competitions and challenges to meet some project-based needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: AI and data talent pathways&#xD;
To meet the challenge of AI talent needs, both departmental and government-wide initiatives are being developed to improve recruitment, retention, and reskilling:&#xD;
&#xD;
Digital Talent Strategy and Platform:&#xD;
The Government of Canada is committed to strengthening AI talent and adoption through the Government of Canada Digital Talent Strategy. Its targeted initiatives include centralized AI-specific recruitment campaigns for data science graduates and the Digital Talent Platform, which simplifies the application process for individuals looking for digital careers in the Government of Canada and helps managers to find pre-qualified digital talent that matches their needs. The Strategy also focuses on developing and retaining AI talent through learning platforms, training opportunities, and partnerships with educational institutions and the Canada School of Public Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Training:&#xD;
CSPS offers a range of courses, events, and resources on AI designed to provide users with a grounding in the knowledge and skills needed for successful and responsible use. These include a data and AI learning pathway, courses, job aids, articles, and videos, and an AI event series.&#xD;
&#xD;
Co-op programs and internships:&#xD;
Co-op programs are widely used by the Government of Canada as a source of new talent but have also been reimagined to support specific AI initiatives. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada established an AI talent pipeline with three post-secondary institutions. Through it, AAFC hired 13 co-op students in 2023-24 and supported in-class projects with the institutions. From this partnership, students received course credit and employment experience, while AAFC received an AI model, with ownership of both IP and data. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Employment and Social Development Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and Statistics Canada have become partners with Mila, offering opportunities to recruit Mila students for internships or post-graduation roles.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="Priority 4: Engagement, transparency, and value to Canadians (Value)" id="id-df6c392d106546069917fcb593891e1f">
      <documentation>Priority 4: Engagement, accountability, and transparency, and value to Canadians&#xD;
Despite the increasing use of AI in Canada, levels of mistrust in AI and its use are high. In public consultations on the AI Strategy, participants expressed a desire for more engagement in the process of designing and developing government AI systems, especially by those more greatly impacted by algorithmic bias or barriers to access. They asked for greater transparency about the government’s AI use through labelling of AI-generated products and information on systems in use, and for information about ways to seek explanations or recourse for decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Strengthen accountability and transparency on AI use&#xD;
The Government of Canada will continue to strengthen and clarify accountabilities for AI use in policy and in notifications about AI use. These will include new requirements and standard language for the disclosure of AI use, explanations of how an AI system reaches a decision, and information about rights and protections, including how to seek explanations or recourse and how to report problems. Lastly, the Government of Canada will identify those AI capabilities that it will not pursue.&#xD;
&#xD;
As part of these efforts, the Government of Canada will prioritize the establishment of a public register of its AI systems. The register will include information about all AI systems that fall within a defined scope, drawing wherever possible on information already collected through Algorithmic Impact Assessments and Personal Information Banks. The scope of the register will be defined and publicized on the register itself and will follow best practice for registers in other jurisdictions, which exclude embedded AI systems and any systems covered by specific policy prohibiting publication. The register will include information about what and how data is being used, how it was trained, and what quality assurance and privacy and security measures are in place. Where information about systems cannot be published, the Government of Canada will develop and publish alternative oversight processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Demonstrate impact and value to Canadians&#xD;
To ensure good stewardship of public resources, the Government of Canada will develop metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate the impact and value of AI initiatives to those we serve. This will track both the cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of AI projects through a range of financial and non-monetary metrics, including costs of implementation, efficiencies and cost savings achieved, service improvements, increased client satisfaction, or increased program uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government of Canada will also develop a framework to track AI adoption. This framework will incorporate metrics for the deployment of AI solutions overall, but also for metrics such as collaboration, sharing, or scaling of solutions to avoid duplication of effort, maximize investment, and reduce costs. The metrics will also track departmental investments in the enablers of AI, including data, infrastructure, and talent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Commit to engagement on AI&#xD;
In keeping with its commitments to meaningful public engagement through the Directive on Open Government, and with the duty to consult, the Government of Canada commits to early and meaningful public and stakeholder engagement on AI initiatives of significant public interest or concern. This will include targeted engagement of communities that face greater impacts, risks or barriers from AI systems and union and employee engagement on workforce impacts. It will also include client participation in system design to ensure that AI systems do not create or perpetuate barriers to access for clients. The Government of Canada will also provide mechanisms for ongoing public feedback and questions on AI used by the federal government.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: Public AI registers&#xD;
Public AI registers are standardized, searchable databases that document the decisions, assumptions, and processes involved in the lifecycle of AI algorithms used by government organizations. AI registers usually include:&#xD;
&#xD;
A non-technical overview of the AI application’s goals, use cases, and impacts.&#xD;
The organizations responsible for the system.&#xD;
Stage and date of system development.&#xD;
Some registers also include information on&#xD;
&#xD;
Data origins, management, processing, and quality issues.&#xD;
Model architecture, key features, parameters, performance, and source code.&#xD;
Bias, accessibility, and how those impacted were involved in system development.&#xD;
Risk levels and mitigation, risk-benefit trade-offs, and impact assessments.&#xD;
Human oversight in development, decision cycles, and monitoring.&#xD;
How those impacted can seek an explanation for decisions.&#xD;
Relevant privacy policies, information and system governance models, supplier contracts, and audit reports.&#xD;
Most registers exclude AI that is embedded within commercial products, such as virtual assistants or spell checkers, but encourage organizations to default to reporting systems if unsure whether they qualify. They also exclude systems that fall under law or policy prohibiting public disclosure, which may be reported to oversight bodies instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
From 2020 to 2024, under Executive Order 14110, the US government required all federal agencies to publish an annual inventory of their planned, new, and existing AI use cases, with exclusions only for very simple rule-based systems, robotic process automation, and defence systems. Other jurisdictions with AI registers include the Netherlands and Scotland, state governments of Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Catalonia, and municipalities of Amsterdam, Helsinki and San Jose.</documentation>

      <documentation>Priority areas&#xD;
Canada’s AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service focuses on four priority areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
Priority 1: Central AI capacity&#xD;
Priority 2: Policy, legislation and governance&#xD;
Priority 3: Talent and training&#xD;
Priority 4: Engagement, transparency, and value to Canadians&#xD;
These priorities were developed in collaboration with a working group of departments that have responsibilities for AI policy or implementation. They were discussed throughout our consultation with partners, stakeholders and the public and in policy consultations across the Government of Canada. They address what we heard as the most pressing needs to advance responsible adoption of AI across the Government of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each of these priorities has a set of accompanying actions. These have been chosen because they are concrete, can be achieved or initiated within the AI Strategy’s two-year timeline, and have the greatest potential to advance responsible AI adoption within the public service. These actions include both ongoing and new work. Some will build on work already begun, or scale innovations and emerging best practices. Others are new actions to respond to emerging needs and known barriers that must be addressed if AI adoption is to succeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
These priorities and the associated actions reflect the time when the AI Strategy was developed. Because the future pace and direction of AI development is highly uncertain, what we and our partners, stakeholders, and clients identify as priorities may be very different at the end of the Strategy’s lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
To remain relevant in this rapidly changing landscape, the AI Strategy and its implementation plan will be reviewed frequently and will be renewed in 2027. Progress on implementation will be reported on a quarterly tracker. In this way we will model the agility needed for AI adoption, adapting our priorities to meet new needs while continuing to collaborate with users and engage those we serve.</documentation>

&#xD;
Environmental impact&#xD;
The Government of Canada should minimize the environmental impact of its AI use by deploying AI appropriately and choosing solutions that demonstrate responsible environmental practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
Transparency and accountability&#xD;
Participants wanted clear communication about how and when AI is used, with labels for AI-generated content and published information about AI systems. They also wanted ways to seek explanations and recourse for system decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Potential uses for AI&#xD;
Participants identified many administrative uses for AI, such as drafting and translating text, managing documents and inboxes, and scheduling personnel processes. They saw potential to use AI to generate insights from large public health, environmental, and economic data sets, and to extract information from legal and policy documents and public consultations to inform decisions. They also proposed using AI to make service and legal case processing more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
No-go areas&#xD;
Areas cited by participants where AI should not be used included decisions on criminal justice cases, hiring, and social service eligibility, because of the risk of bias and the need for explainability and individual discretion. Participants also felt AI should not be used for mass data collection or surveillance, or to make policy decisions without human input.</documentation>

Canadian Press Newswire&#xD;
Published: 2025-05-21&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney says single government mandate letter reflects a 'unified mission'&#xD;
&#xD;
OTTAWA _ Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out a handful of collective core priorities for his new ministers on Wednesday, vowing his government will work to bring down the cost of living and reconfigure some of Canada's most important international relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney released just one single mandate letter publicly for his entire cabinet, rather than the traditional spate of individual assignments. He said this shows every member of his cabinet shares ''a unified mission.''&#xD;
&#xD;
''This one letter outlines the core priorities of Canada's new government, reflecting the mandate that Canadians have given to us,'' he said.&#xD;
&#xD;
''The government is charged to build the strongest economy in the G7, an economy that works for everyone, to bring down the cost of living for Canadian families, to keep our country's security -- our communities -- safe, to develop a new economic and security relationship with the United States, and to build new partnerships with reliable allies around the world.''&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney made the comments while speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill after holding a secretive, two-day retreat with his new cabinet in Gatineau, Que.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a break from the tradition followed by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, media were not allowed on site at Meech Lake to ask ministers questions _ placing the spotlight squarely on Carney this evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
Several ministers made headlines in the last week by giving conflicting messages to the media on pipeline policy, reporting there would be no budget until fall and declaring that lowering housing prices would be the wrong approach to making homes more affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
The letter explicitly directs them to assess how they should proceed to govern through their individual departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
''Over the coming weeks, I will look to each of you to identify the key goals and measures of success on which to evaluate the results you will achieve for Canadians as a member of the Ministry,'' the letter reads.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the mandate letter, Carney also said he expects each cabinet committee, led by a chair, to ''drive and monitor'' progress. He said that should be done with oversight from the priorities, planning and strategy committee _ chaired by the prime minister _ and direction from the full cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
A number of new cabinet committees were announced last week that reflect the government's focus on shoring up Canada's sovereignty and improving the quality of life of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
They include a new ''Build Canada'' committee, focused on strengthening Canada's economy and a committee on government transformation and efficiency, aiming to reduce government spending.&#xD;
&#xD;
Other new groups include a committee on operations and parliamentary affairs, a committee for ''quality of life and wellbeing'' and a committee on a ''secure and sovereign Canada'' that aims to reinforce Canadian sovereignty, manage Canada-U.S. relations and advance Canada's interests around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney spoke with journalists after emerging from what his office called a cabinet ''planning forum'' held at Meech Lake to prepare for the new sitting of Parliament that starts next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the press conference Wednesday, Carney was also asked about Liberal MPs considering adopting Reform Act rules to have the power to trigger a leadership review.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said all recognized parties in Parliament are bound by the Reform Act and that votes will take place at the first caucus meeting on Sunday.&#xD;
&#xD;
''I observe that this will happen,'' Carney said.&#xD;
&#xD;
The new minority Parliament meets for the first time on Monday to elect a new House Speaker and will watch King Charles III deliver the speech from the throne on Tuesday.&#xD;

Carney's singular mandate letter a welcome change, promises 'narrow' focus for upcoming Parliament, say insiders&#xD;
By: Marco Vigliotti&#xD;
&#xD;
Prime Minister Mark Carney released his mandate letter to cabinet on Wednesday, spelling out a broad list of priorities for his re-elected Liberal government, including establishing a new economic and security relationship with the U.S., removing internal trade barriers and reducing costs for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
It represents a break from the tradition established by Justin Trudeau, where each minister received instructions unique to their portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said Canadians &quot;elected a new government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone,&quot; and his cabinet &quot;must fulfill this mandate with purpose and force.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;We must meet a series of unprecedented challenges with both a disciplined focus on core priorities and new approaches to governing.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney's seven priorities for cabinet are mostly restated commitments from the this past spring's election campaign, including safeguarding Canadian sovereignty by bolstering border security and strengthening the military, returning immigration rates to &quot;sustainable levels,&quot; reducing spending on government operations, and spurring home construction through public-private cooperation (via the creation of new federal body Build Canada Homes) and investments in the skilled trades.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said Canada &quot;faces a series of crises,&quot; while the global trading system - a source of the country's prosperity for decades - undergoes the &quot;biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
He blamed &quot;longstanding weak productivity&quot; for &quot;straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;The new federal government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing,&quot; Carney writes.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;We must redefine Canada's international, commercial, and security relationships. In the process, we need to develop a defence industrial policy that secures Canada, fulfills our responsibilities to our allies, and helps build our economy.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Carlene Variyan, a former chief of staff in the Trudeau government, said Carney's mandate letter was a &quot;very effective way&quot; of signalling that this new cabinet has &quot;a narrow and disciplined focus in a time of perceived crisis.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;A lot of people who have served in government and were involved in the drafting of mandate letters probably thought yesterday 'why didn't I think of that?' It's quite clever,&quot; she told iPolitics.&#xD;
&#xD;
Variyan, an associate vice-president with Summa Strategies, also said the streamlined focus of the mandate letter contrasts sharply with the 73-member strong shadow cabinet and leadership team unveiled by the Conservatives on Wednesday. Carney's cabinet, unveiled last week, boasts 29 cabinet ministers and 10 secretaries of state.&#xD;
&#xD;
Erin Morrison, who previously served as Jagmeet Singh's director of communications, said the mandate letter provides an opportunity for the hobbled NDP, which took only 7 seats in the April 28 vote, losing official party status.&#xD;
&#xD;
She said Carney's priorities &quot;make it clear that this is a Liberal Party that's moving quite a bit to the right,&quot; pointing to his calls to reduce spending and using private-public partnerships to support new housing construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;[This is] further right than than we ever seen the Liberal Party. Among his seven priorities, he's got cuts and the P3 (public-private partnership) form of privatization, the things that really are at the core of of the NDP working with the labor movement and the progressive movements in Canada,&quot; said Morrison, principal of Morrison Comms and acting vice president of Texture Communications.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;I do not think Canadians will be immediately insulted or upset by Carney's priority list, but I do think the NDP will read it with the insight it needs, and then start picking it apart.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Morrison said she expects the NDP to &quot;punch above its weight&quot; in the next session of Parliament, providing a counter-weight to Carney's policies that appear to be similar to those advanced by the Conservatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
She credited interim leader Don Davies as &quot;super smart&quot; and a &quot;powerful speaker,&quot; and anticipated that the party will emerge with a &quot;unified plan and vision,&quot; compared to the &quot;adrift&quot; Conservative caucus that seems to be debating its future direction after struggling to contrast against the more centre-right Carney during the campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;They're not clear on what they're criticizing anymore because the Liberals match all their policies. They agree on everything. So, you know, what is there to ask about in question period? Who can axe the tax faster? I think they're now at a loss.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Variyan said it's unfair to label Carney as leading a centre-right government, pointing to campaign pledges to protect programs like pharmacare and dentalcare, and invest in universal child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;Those are very much commitments reflective of a progressive party that wants to form a progressive government. There is nothing in the language of that mandate letter that excludes progressive action to do things like broaden the social safety net. Nothing in that mandate letter that blocks further steps toward embracing an energy transition or reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,&quot; she said.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;This very streamlined, singular mandate letter is going to be met with some surprise and some trepidation from stakeholders of government because it's not the way that we're used to doing things. Over the past 10 years, it's become a very useful tool for holding ministers accountable to the things that they were assigned to do, and holding governments accountable. We're not used to having a prime minister set out such a streamlined list of priorities, but it will not fundamentally change the government's approach to implementing the platform that it was elected on.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Conservative strategist Kate Harrison said while the mandate letter does touch upon some Conservative demands, how the Liberals address these concerns will open up opportunities for the Tories.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;You know [Conservative Leader] Pierre Poilievre invited the prime minister to steal his ideas, and it appears that's happening to some extent in terms of the areas of focus [in the mandate letter],&quot; she said.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;I think that the issue will be all about implementation. So, there's talk in the mandate letter about the importance of housing. Well, Conservatives would dispute that more government built housing is the way that you improve affordability. A new agency to deal with this, is that what we need, or is it more removal of red tape? So I think that there will be room to quibble with the how some of these things are done.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Harrison, a vice-chair at Summa, acknowledged that Carney's streamlined mandate latter could help &quot;cabinet stay stay focused and keep their eye on the prize,&quot; saying the former Trudeau front bench struggled because they had &quot;arguably too many priorities&quot; and were &quot;spread too thin&quot; to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
But she said the Liberals missed an opportunity to hog the spotlight and take advantage of the Poilievre being absent from the Commons by slow-walking the start of their term, highlighted by the refusal to bring in a budget this spring.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;These are really key opportunities for the Opposition to kind of show how they would be different and how they would do things differently. But, the government doesn't seem to be in a rush to want to prioritize those those things. And so I'm not sure that the Conservatives and Poilievre are missing much of an opportunity, at least in the in terms of the next few months.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mandate letter priorities&#xD;
1. Establishing a new economic and security relationship with the United States and strengthening our collaboration with reliable trading partners and allies around the world.&#xD;
2. Building one Canadian economy by removing barriers to interprovincial trade and identifying and expediting nation-building projects that will connect and transform our country.&#xD;
3. Bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them to get ahead.&#xD;
4. Making housing more affordable by unleashing the power of public-private cooperation, catalysing a modern housing industry, and creating new careers in the skilled trades.&#xD;
5. Protecting Canadian sovereignty and keeping Canadians safe by strengthening the Canadian Armed Forces, securing our borders, and reinforcing law enforcement.&#xD;
6. Attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.&#xD;
7. Spending less on government operations so that Canadians can invest more in the people and businesses that will build the strongest economy in the G7.&#xD;

      <documentation>Building new relationships with the United States and the world&#xD;
The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government is working to strengthen its relationships with reliable trading partners and allies around the world, recognizing that Canada has what the world needs and the values the world respects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada is ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries that share its values, that believe in international co-operation and the free and open exchange of goods, services, and ideas. In this new, fast-evolving world, Canada is ready to lead. This will be demonstrated in June, when Canada convenes the G7 Summit.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a more affordable Canada" id="id-617a9f0e419d43ecad2c81812ac2be5f">
      <documentation>Building a more affordable Canada&#xD;
The Government is guided by its conviction that the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone. Many Canadians are struggling to get ahead. The Government is responding, reducing middle-class taxes and saving two-income families up to $840 a year. It will cut the GST on homes at or under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, delivering savings of up to $50,000. And it will lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect the programs that are already saving families thousands of dollars every year. These include child care and pharmacare. In addition to these, the Government has recently expanded the Canadian Dental Care Plan to cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a stronger Canada" id="id-3b39161d3aa04407a1eb981026fba674">
      <documentation>Building a stronger Canada&#xD;
The Government’s overarching goal – its core mission – is to build the strongest economy in the G7. That starts with creating one Canadian economy out of thirteen. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year. The Government will introduce legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility by Canada Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Numerous premiers have already taken vital steps to break down provincial and territorial barriers to trade. Together, we will build on that progress to deliver free trade across the nation by Canada Day. This is critical to unlocking Canada’s full economic potential, but it’s not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build Canada strong, the Government is working closely with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples to identify and catalyse projects of national significance. Projects that will connect Canada, that will deepen Canada’s ties with the world, and that will create high-paying jobs for generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Given the pace of change and the scale of opportunities, speed is of the essence. Through the creation of a new Major Federal Project Office, the time needed to approve a project will be reduced from five years to two; all while upholding Canada’s world-leading environmental standards and its constitutional obligations to Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also strike co-operation agreements with every interested province and territory within six months to realize its goal of “one project, one review.”&#xD;
&#xD;
When Canadians come together, Canada builds things that last.&#xD;
&#xD;
By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don’t just survive ongoing trade wars, but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world’s leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change. To build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the skilled trades. And to build Canada into the world’s leading hub for science and innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Critically, the Government will undertake a series of measures to help double the rate of home building while creating an entirely new housing industry – using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, and Canadian lumber. The Government will introduce measures to deliver affordable homes by creating Build Canada Homes. This mission-driven organization will act to accelerate the development of new affordable housing. It will invest in the growth of the prefabricated and modular housing industry. And it will provide significant financing to affordable home builders. The Government will make the housing market work better, including by cutting municipal development charges in half for all multi-unit housing. The Government will drive supply up to bring housing costs down.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a safer and more secure Canada " id="id-e0b5e46690954c528c5132f6e7127c20">
      <documentation>Building a safer and more secure Canada &#xD;
To be truly strong, Canada must be secure. To that end, the Government will introduce legislation to enhance security at Canada’s borders. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will have new tools to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors. The Canada Border Services Agency will be given new powers to examine goods destined for export, to prevent the transport of illegal and stolen products, including cars.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect Canada’s sovereignty by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will boost Canada’s defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada’s European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad. To keep communities safe, the Government will hire 1,000 more RCMP personnel. It will change firearms licensing and strengthen enforcement of yellow and red flag laws. Weapons licences for those convicted of intimate partner violence and those subject to protection orders will be revoked. Through the deployment of scanners, drones and helicopters, additional personnel, and K-9 teams, the Government will stem the tide of illegal guns and drugs across the border.&#xD;
&#xD;
It will take these steps while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners and Indigenous Peoples’ longstanding hunting traditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will bring a renewed focus on car theft and home invasions by toughening the Criminal Code to make bail harder to get for repeat offenders charged with committing these crimes, along with human trafficking and drug smuggling.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a united Canada" id="id-f141ad084b89423a89131779ff68df12">
      <documentation>Building a united Canada&#xD;
During this time of great change, Canadians are uniting behind what makes Canada unique.&#xD;
&#xD;
The French language and the Quebec culture are at the heart of the Canadian identity. They define the country that Canadians and I love so much. Canada is a country that respects and celebrates its official languages and Indigenous languages. The Government is determined to protect the institutions that bring these cultures and this identity to the world, like CBC/Radio-Canada. It will protect the people who give us access to fresh, healthy, and quality food: agricultural producers. And it will protect supply management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nature is core to Canada’s identity. In 2022, Canada convened COP15 in Montréal, which concluded with 196 countries striking a historic agreement to protect 30 percent of their lands and 30 percent of waters by 2030. To this end, the Government will protect more of Canada’s nature than ever before through the creation of new national parks, national urban parks, marine protected areas, and other conservation initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will always protect the rights and freedoms that the Charter guarantees for every Canadian.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will be a reliable partner to Indigenous Peoples, upholding its fundamental commitment to advancing reconciliation. Central to this commitment is the creation of long-term wealth and prosperity with Indigenous Peoples. For that reason, the Government will double the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program from $5 billion to $10 billion – enabling more Indigenous communities to become owners of major projects. As Canada moves forward with nation-building projects, the Government will always be firmly guided by the principle of free, prior, and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s immigration system has long been a source of pride for Canadians and of dynamism for the economy. The Government is dedicated to rebuilding the trust of Canadians in immigration by restoring balance to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will cap the total number of temporary foreign workers and international students to less than five percent of Canada’s population by 2027. By doing this, the Government will attract the best talent in the world to build our economy, while sending a clear message to Canadians working abroad that there is no better time to come home.</documentation>

      <documentation>Building Canada Strong by spending less and investing more&#xD;
In all of its actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can invest more.&#xD;
&#xD;
Day-to-day government spending – the government’s operating budget – has been growing by nine percent every year. The Government will introduce measures to bring it below two percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Transfers to provinces, territories, or individuals will be maintained. The Government will balance its operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication, and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government will take a series of measures to catalyse new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. The scale of the Government’s initiative will match the challenges of our times and the ambitions of Canadians.</documentation>

      <documentation>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians. The Department collects, manages, and uses vast amounts of data every day—in everything from service delivery to policy and program development. Equipping the right people with the right insights to make the right decisions at the right time across the Department is key to better understanding our clients and how we make a difference in Canadians’ lives from coast to coast to coast. At the same time, it ensures that we get the most value from data while mitigating risks to Canadians. &#xD;
&#xD;
The objective of the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is to bring ESDC further along the path towards achieving better services and outcomes for all Canadians. The Strategy aims to empower departmental employees to collectively treat data as enterprise assets, grounded in a culture of data stewardship and collaboration, that spans across policy analysis and research throughto evaluation and reporting back to Canadians. It outlines enterprise direction for equipping employees with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to deliver on the organizational mandate. It also supports us in strengthening our ability to monitor our programs, enhance operational efficiencies and leverage and adapt to changing technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).&#xD;
&#xD;
Progress made in implementing the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy will also support ESDC’s first AI Strategy, as well as the advancement of the Government of Canada’s 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service and establishment of Canada’s first AI Strategy. On all of these fronts, our effortswill be rooted in a human-centric approach based on human rights, transparency, openness, and respect for the protection of personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the core of creating a seamless client service experience and generating value for Canadians is the ability to manage, find, understand, trust, share and use data as corporate and strategic assets. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is centered on four key Service Areas – Data Innovation, Data Governance and Trust, Data Culture and Literacy, and Foundational Data Infrastructure. Focusing on these Service Areas will enable the Department toidentify and manage opportunities and risks, while helping us to implement improvements that allow for the scaling of advanced data and analytical methods. &#xD;
&#xD;
The world is changing rapidly, the status quo is no longer adequate, and ESDC must be agile to meet these challenges head on. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy lays down the foundation for the future of datadriven work at ESDC. The Strategy is designed to evolve as new opportunities and priorities arise. As technologies and advanced methods evolve, the Strategy positions us to continue to execute on our commitment to the responsible and innovative use of data to realize wide-ranging benefits across the Department. It also sets the direction on how we continue to leverage data efficiently to drive key initiatives that improve programs and service delivery, to support modernization and transformation initiatives, and to measure our impact and results on the lives of Canadians.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Governance and Trust are key concepts for the foundation of sustainable data management. Canadians entrust the Government of Canada and ESDC with their data. They expect that it will be used responsibly and kept secure. Data Governance is about creating a system of decision rights and accountabilities for data that are executed according to agreed-upon models.&#xD;
&#xD;
 The trust of the Canadian public is not a given, and it is up to ESDC and other federal government organizations to foster public trust in how the Government of Canada uses their data. Data Governance describeswho can take what actions with what data, under what circumstances, and using what methods. It is also about being open with the public about these processes to improve public trust in Government.</documentation>

      <documentation>For a large organization like ESDC, a one-size-fits-all approach to data governance might not be realistic. The data governance program follows an adaptive approach that recognizes that data governance practices exist across the organization. It allows the flexibility to apply different governance approaches to specific business scenarios while providing enterprise guidance and standards. For example, employ inga top-down approach to data governance when implementing new activities, such as the ESDC Data Accountability Framework, or employing a bottom-up approach through the outputs of working-level groups such as the Enterprise Dat Stewardship Network.</documentation>

The launch of the Canadian Dental Care Plan has opened the door to affordable dental care for eligible individuals across the country. More recently, Service Canada began processing applications for the Canada Disability Benefit, delivering direct financial support to persons with disabilities.&#xD;
This work goes beyond fairness—it’s about creating meaningful change, empowering individuals, and helping Canadians build a stronger future by unlocking their full potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
Élargir l’accès aux programmes essentiels&#xD;
Service Canada continue d’élargir l’accès à des programmes essentiels qui favorisent la santé et le bien-être financier des Canadiens. Le lancement du Régime canadien de soins dentaires a ouvert la voie à des soins dentaires abordables aux personnes admissibles à travers le pays. Plus récemment, Service Canada a amorcé le traitement des demandes pour la Prestation canadienne pour les personnes handicapées, qui offre du soutien financier direct aux personnes en situation de handicap. &#xD;
Ce travail va au-delà de l’équité, il s’agit de créer un véritable changement, de favoriser l’autonomie des individus et d’aider les Canadiens à bâtir un avenir plus solide en leur permettant de s’épanouir pleinement.</documentation>

As Canadians’ needs continue to evolve, Service Canada has expanded its offerings to provide more accessible and responsive support. One key advancement has been the enhancement of self-serve tools for Old Age Security (OAS) clients. Today, more than 7.4 million Canadians can apply for OAS benefits online, update personal information, upload documents and access or download their tax slips—all through a streamlined digital service. &#xD;
&#xD;
Moderniser et améliorer la prestation des services&#xD;
À mesure que les besoins des Canadiens évoluent, Service Canada a élargi son offre afin de fournir du soutien plus accessible et plus réactif. L’une des principales avancées a été l’amélioration des outils libre-service pour les clients de la Sécurité de la vieillesse (SV). Aujourd’hui, plus de 7,4 millions de Canadiens peuvent demander des prestations de la SV en ligne, mettre à jour leurs renseignements personnels, télécharger des documents et accéder à leurs relevés fiscaux ou les télécharger, le tout grâce à un service numérique simplifié. </documentation>

      <documentation>Data Quality&#xD;
Poor quality data will sabotage any data integration effort and subsequently harm the business. This is an issue for data integration projects that combine data from sources of variable quality. The quality of the result is crucial to its success. This means keeping track of the lineage of the integrated data, and always paying attention to its quality.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Keep Data Synchronized" id="id-66a23376d33a44619c281bfeaff10317">
      <documentation>Synchronizing Data&#xD;
Often, different systems, or different applications on the same system, use the same data and maintain their own copies. These may be exact copies, or they may include only part of the data, or the data they include may be transformed from the original.&#xD;
For example, a company may maintain core data as a “single source of truth” and different divisions and departments may transform it in different business-specific ways so that it has relevance and purpose for them.&#xD;
Keeping these versions synchronized as the data changes can be a major challenge.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Make Efforts To Understand the Data" id="id-386c001b53a14b2fa2ccc6292fcd4af8">
      <documentation>Understanding the Data&#xD;
The first challenge of data integration is to understand the data. This is a problem at two levels.&#xD;
At a higher level, there is the need to understand the business context and the value of the data: to know which parts of it are important, and which combinations of it can contribute to business deliverables.&#xD;
At the most basic level, the problem is a lack of data models and documentation. The data is often described only by cryptic entity, attribute, and domain field names that meant something to the business subject matter expert, programmer, or database administrator who hurriedly created them to satisfy system constraints or a production deadline, but are incomprehensible to those conducting the data integration or data migration effort.&#xD;
As discussed in An Information Architecture Vision: Moving from Data Rich to Information Smart (see References), possibly 10% of data holdings are documented, and the cryptic definition of entities, attributes, and domain values is often incomprehensible. In addition, without overarching data models there tends to be major redundancy, leading to poor data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are four main issues that are encountered:&#xD;
• Enterprise-structured data holdings are embedded within individual applications using incoherent tables in separate database files&#xD;
• In some legacy systems, data may be embedded in the system code or retained using flat or indexed file paradigms that are inaccessible by current standard structured query languages&#xD;
• When Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications or cloud services are used, often the data structures are not provided and there is only limited data download access&#xD;
• There is often no or limited metadata&#xD;
&#xD;
Metadata provides a context for the data, addressing items such as who created the data and when, the security classification, the data quality, and so on. Metadata is key to effective data integration, especially when redundant data must be consolidated, and new metadata generated.</documentation>

      <documentation>Organizational and Cultural Issues&#xD;
Even with the support of technology, data integration requires skill, and its results may impact different parts of the enterprise. Ensuring that the right people are in place, with the right training, and that the affected departments are prepared for the change, is a major challenge.&#xD;
There may well be a need to review the enterprise’s data governance regimen. For major data integration projects in areas fundamental to the enterprise, there may be a need to review its culture, especially executive willingness to maintain and share data.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Contribute To Data Defense" id="id-a4db80987d694285bfd7bac6f50455fa">
      <documentation>Data Defense&#xD;
Maintaining data quality is just one of the aspects of good data defense – minimizing the risks to a company that arise from its data. This also includes ensuring compliance with regulations, using analytics to detect and limit fraud, and building systems to ensure the security and integrity of the data. Data integration systems must be robust and secure, and contribute to the overall defense of the data.&#xD;
Legislative compliance is a particular issue. Integrated data may contravene privacy or other legislation. Consequently, it may need to be further processed (e.g., anonymized) before it can be used, or perhaps even restructured to accommodate potentially costly legal requirements such as data subject access requests.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="View Data Integration As A Continuous Process" id="id-9d3b33bddd0e43d8b5b450550cacbafe">
      <documentation>Data Fabric&#xD;
A data fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment. It enables a single and consistent data management framework, which allows seamless data access and processing by design across otherwise siloed storage. It may use analytics to constantly monitor data pipelines and support the design, deployment, and utilization of diverse data. Gartner® Data and Analysis Trends, 2021 (see References) claim that this can reduce time for integration by 30%, deployment by 30%, and maintenance by 70%.&#xD;
A data fabric has an application interface, and often also a user interface. It gives the ability to write data, as well as to read it. The sources may be on-premise or in the cloud. Data fabrics deliver a unified, intelligent, and integrated end-to-end platform to support data use-cases. They provide the ability to deliver use-cases quickly by leveraging innovation in dynamic integration, distributed, and multi-cloud architectures, graph engines, and distributed in-memory and persistent memory platforms. Data fabric focuses on automating the process integration, transformation, preparation, curation, security, governance, and orchestration to enable analytics and insights quickly for business success. It minimizes complexity by automating processes, workflows, and pipelines, generating code, and streamlining data to accelerate various use-cases.&#xD;
An application can read data from or update data in multiple sources, describing the data in terms of a common data model. The read and update requests are converted by data platforms to requests that describe the data in terms of the source data models. The data is then obtained from the sources and integrated, or updated in the sources, by continual synchronization or dynamic query.</documentation>

      <documentation>Mapping Between Different Data Models&#xD;
&#xD;
Typically, independently created data sources are based on different data models. This reflects the fact that they have different scopes, though often with some common elements, and represent different views of the world. For the sources to be integrated, there must be mappings between their data models and a third, common data model.&#xD;
When the number of sources to be integrated is large, the problem of mapping them is extremely complex and difficult. There are, however, technologies that can help the data engineer to perform this task.</documentation>

The remaining sections of this document identify and briefly describe the relevant standards and discuss some wider considerations. They are:&#xD;
• Representation Standards – dealing with how information is represented as data at a fundamental level in data sets and APIs&#xD;
These standards can apply to source data, integrated data, and contextual metadata.&#xD;
• Structure Standards – dealing with how data is structured in data sets and APIs&#xD;
These standards also can apply to source data, integrated data, and contextual metadata.&#xD;
• API Standards – dealing with additional considerations where data is obtained from or posted to APIs, rather than being read from or written to data sets&#xD;
• Metadata Standards – applying mainly to contextual metadata but in some cases also to metadata included in source data or integrated data&#xD;
• Data Analysis and Transformation Standards – applying to software components that perform analysis or transformation&#xD;
• Wider Considerations for Data Integration Standards – discussing some existing standards and best practices that might be relevant, and new standards work that might be useful in relation to non-technical aspects of data integration</documentation>

Statement:	Provide maximum long-term benefits to the enterprise as a whole, while optimizing total costs of ownership and risks.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Enterprise needs over business unit or project needs&#xD;
•	Enterprise priorities are above priorities of a business unit or a project&#xD;
•	Decisions based on the whole government have a greater long-term value than decisions with a certain perspective of a group with a specific interest&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Client needs must be addressed and opportunities leveraged for creating value by considering and selecting the appropriate approach and solutions in the following order:&#xD;
    o	Pan-Canadian ; then;&#xD;
    o	Government of Canada whole-of-government; then&#xD;
    o	Government of Canada Cluster; then&#xD;
    o	Department-wide, holistic and horizontal; then&#xD;
    o	Program or project specific.&#xD;
•	The reach of  an architecture  should allow for  Act as one &#xD;
•	Solutions must aim to maximize the cumulative business benefits over their entire lifecycle.&#xD;
•	Investment proposals must link to business/IT strategy and goals.&#xD;
•	Business value realization must be tracked and demonstrated on all major investments. &#xD;
•	Common solutions and shared services that benefit the enterprise over one-off solutions for one sector or region are preferred. &#xD;
•	Organizational readiness for adopting new solutions are analyzed and taken into account.&#xD;

•	Clients are able to determine their  level of engagement with the government and/or department as permitted by legislation, public policy and program policy&#xD;
•	Services must be delivered across multiple channels using modern architectures. &#xD;
•	Where appropriate, clients are directed into lower cost channels.&#xD;
•	Service levels must be defined for client services provided. &#xD;
•	Services must be measured to improve performance.&#xD;
•	A cross-government strategy must be built for common citizen and business data sets (e.g. name, address) and common client applications (e.g. authentication, payments, notifications).&#xD;

Statement: Achieving  the mandate and strategic goals of ESDC&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	A business led and focused architecture is more successful in:&#xD;
    o	Supporting the department’s mandate&#xD;
    o	Achieving the strategic goals&#xD;
    o	Responding to changes in client and stakeholder  needs and expectations &#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Interoperability&#xD;
Statement:	Interoperability allows the enterprise to interact, connect and operate with other parties within its business and IT ecosystem in an effective and efficient manner. &#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Changes in the business and IT ecosystem  may impact ESDC ability to meet its mandate and achieve its strategic goals.&#xD;
•	ESDC collaborates with other parties to meet its mandate and achieve its strategic goals. &#xD;
•	ESDC uses the services of 3rd Party Service Providers to meet its mandate and achieve its strategic goals.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
Service &#xD;
•	Interoperability requirements are defined and considered from the onset of an initiative &#xD;
•	Interoperability standards and industry standards must be followed unless there is a compelling business reason to implement a non-standard.&#xD;
•	Need to understand  all the parties, including their role and responsibilities, that are part of the ESDC business and IT ecosystem. &#xD;
•	A party’s role and responsibilities within the ESDC ecosystem is formalized and underpinned by the appropriate vehicle (e.g. legislation, regulation, agreement, etc.).&#xD;

      <documentation>3.1.	Business Continuity&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Business Continuity&#xD;
Statement:	Operations are maintained in case of events that may or are known to cause service or system interruptions.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Business activities continue regardless of external events. &#xD;
•	Hardware failure, natural disasters, and data corruption do not disrupt or stop enterprise activities. &#xD;
•	The enterprise business functions are capable of operating leveraging redundant information delivery mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The risks of business interruption must be established in advance and managed. (Management includes but is not limited to planning, testing and monitoring business continuity and IT service recovery, periodic reviews, testing for vulnerabilities and exposure, or designing mission-critical services in a way that ensures business function continuity through redundant or alternative capabilities.)&#xD;
•	Services and applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the ESDC’s mission to determine which continuity level is required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented.&#xD;
•	Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability of enabling services and systems must be considered throughout their design and use. &#xD;
•	Technology lifecycle must be actively managed.&#xD;
•	Technology must be regularly and proactively upgraded.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Accessibility&#xD;
Statement:	ESDC services are accessible on an equitable basis to clients&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services needs to be accessible to the widest set of consumers. Channel independence ensures that clients have a choice of access options. While information and services need to be accessed in a variety of ways, the information and services must be delivered in an integrated, consistent fashion.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Services should be designed to operate consistently across multiple delivery channels.&#xD;
•	Programs will need to resource significant additional effort in human interface design.&#xD;
•	In designing services, programs will need to consider accessibility by, and interoperability with, automated services.&#xD;

      <documentation>3.3.	Value&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Value&#xD;
Statement:	Government business initiatives and investments must represent value for money and return a business benefit.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The value and cost of investments need to be measurable in objective terms. A government service that does not have an understood return on investment (ROI) is unlikely to receive the on-going support and commitment that will make it sustainable.&#xD;
•	Service delivery can create complicated cost/benefit models, particularly where there are cross-jurisdictional boundaries. The benefits realized through a service may not be recorded by the program and/or programs that are required to invest. A thorough understanding of the costs and benefits is required to establish an appropriate investment model to support the creation and on-going management of the service.&#xD;
•	It is mandatory for programs to meet the GC procurement rules for:&#xD;
    o	 value for money,&#xD;
    o	 encouraging competition,&#xD;
    o	efficient, effective and ethical use of resources, and&#xD;
    o	accountability and transparency.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be fit for purpose and deliver value and benefit.&#xD;
•	Business initiatives will need to be prioritized in terms of their relation to the GC and department vision, policies, strategies and plans.&#xD;
•	The department will need to assess the ROI for each business initiative.&#xD;
•	Public ROI should be based on the department taking a rewards-based approach to ROI measurement and encompass the following three areas:&#xD;
    o	Financial ROI:  Traditional or “classic” measurement of financial gains with quantifiable results. These ROI is direct, measureable benefits and costs e.g., reduced transaction costs (such as in procurement by reducing the cost creating a purchase order from $28 to $21) or fewer steps in the workflow of approving a budget request&#xD;
    o	Social ROI:  Impact of government services on a societal level This ROI is indirect and difficult to measure public good benefits and costs e.g., are citizens safer? Are children in a particular jurisdiction receiving adequate social services? Are the vulnerable receiving sufficient support?&#xD;
    o	Political ROI: Impacts the system of governing and policy decision making. This ROI is motivational feasibility of the project, or the benefits of interested parties (champions, opponents, decision makers) e.g., are we delivering government programs that match policies, legislation and mandates? Are we delivering on the promises of our politicians?&#xD;
•	In addition to assessing the public ROI for each business initiative, a total cost of ownership (TCO) approach will be required. The TCO will need to assess the investment against other priorities, as well as balancing the costs of development, support, security, risk mitigation, disaster recovery and retirement against the costs of government’s requirements for flexibility, scalability, ease of use and reduction of integration complexity.&#xD;
•	There will need to be improved whole-of-government usage of business benefit management and benchmarking,&#xD;

      <documentation>3.4.	Reliable&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Reliable&#xD;
Statement:	Departmental services are reliable, accurate, relevant and timely.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The take-up and use of lower cost channels will depend on users of government services trusting the ability of the government to provide reliable, accurate, relevant and timely information to consumers.&#xD;
•	Reliable services that provide consistent outcomes will help to reduce complaints, reviews and appeals from consumers.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The department  will need to deliver services and information which clients can rely upon. &#xD;
•	 The department, and  programs will need to devote effort towards service design and service performance management to ensure reliable services&#xD;
•	Good processes create good services and data. Processes will need to be the focus of ongoing continuous improvement (which in turn will improve reliability, accuracy, relevancy and timeliness of the service). &#xD;
•	 The department will need to provide trusted services and information to individuals, and organizations. The outcomes of these services and information will strengthened the trust in the department and Government of Canada. &#xD;
•	The department and programs will  need to collaboration  with other departments and programs to deliver, manage and measure services to ensure the services are achieving the desired outcomes&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Cohesiveness&#xD;
Statement:	Departments shall present a consistent and unified face of government through a common and integrated approach to service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Government services are presented to clients in a consistent and cohesive manner. This means that clients of government services should only need to present a piece of information to government once. Similarly, clients will be presented with a common look, feel and experience regardless of what department service or channel they are accessing at the time. This presentation of a consistent government face will reduce the impact of internal government change (for example, department/program amalgamations and restructures) on clients, and potentially reduce the flow on costs of such changes. Adoption and continued use of a service by clients will depend, to an extent, on ease of use enhanced by consistency of service delivery.&#xD;
•	With the introduction of common services and the reduction of duplicate services, the Government/Department has the opportunity to reduce costs.&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Departments and Programs will need to collaborate in the development of services. This will require open sharing of information, cross-department/program planning, and understanding of whole-of-government service channels, segments and lines of business.&#xD;
•	To achieve consistent and interoperable service across the whole-of-government, the government, department and its programs will need to agree and use common technologies, open industry standards and open architectures.&#xD;
•	The department and programs will need to align service delivery with whole-of-government policies, strategies and frameworks.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to reduce integration complexity.&#xD;
•	Departments and programs will need to incorporate the seamless use of interoperable applications, data and information across various sourcing models and operating environments.&#xD;

Name:	Optimize Services&#xD;
Statement:	Across the business domain, we will enable simple, flexible, efficient and reusable services.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	By focusing on increasing the efficiency, effectiveness, value and quality of our processes we will increase the maturity and stability of what we do (our business capabilities). We won’t be dragged down by non-optimized solutions and designs and reduce risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Test and iterate our models and plans more often. &#xD;
•	Favour small incremental pieces that integrate seamlessly and can be reused across the organization. &#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Accessible-by-Default&#xD;
&#xD;
Statement:	Information and data is open, accessible and easy to use by default, however protected within closed environments when it includes personally identify  and/or sensitive data &#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	The Government of Canada strives to provide Canadians with access to the data that is produced, collected, and used by departments and agencies across the federal government through a single and searchable window.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are easily findable and consumable, in the appropriate format for a variety of users and scenarios.&#xD;
•	Benefits of open data include:&#xD;
    o	Support for innovation&#xD;
    o	Advancing the government's accountability and democratic reform &#xD;
    o	Leveraging public sector information to develop consumer and commercial products &#xD;
    o	Better use of existing investment in broadband and community information infrastructure &#xD;
    o	Support for research &#xD;
    o	Support informed decisions for clients &#xD;
    o	Proactive Disclosure&#xD;
•	Information and Data are ubiquitous, but to be of business value the constraints challenging its access and use must be mitigated as much as is appropriate to do so. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Unless sensitive or containing personally identifiable data, the data is accessible to all employees of ESDC.&#xD;
•	When designing services and systems, opportunities for publishing open data must be explored. Data can be published in different formats, or made accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). &#xD;
•	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide on-demand access to large, timely or complex data.&#xD;
•	Information and Data holdings must be aligned to business needs and functions.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are clearly catalogued, easily discoverable and easily accessible.&#xD;
•	Access must be closely tied to understanding of the data, otherwise inappropriate use may occur.&#xD;
•	Information and Data consumers’ awareness and education of data sources must be sustained.&#xD;
•	Information and Data are in the appropriate tool and format for use and users know how to access it.&#xD;
•	Efficient / timely access to information / data and its protection are not mutually exclusive concepts.&#xD;
•	Information and Data repositories need to be managed to reduce redundancies and duplication.&#xD;
•	Information and Data presentation must match generally accepted internal or external standards.&#xD;
•	Levels of aggregation or disaggregation are appropriate for consumption purposes.&#xD;
•	Timeliness of access permits the right data to be available when it is needed.&#xD;
•	Mashup of Information and Data will push the boundaries of user understanding and will need training and support.&#xD;
•	Knowledge repositories should capture enterprise information in ways to be useful as a basis for designing programs and services to improve future outcomes.&#xD;
•	Business and Information Professionals must partner to ensure user/consumer perspective is enabled.&#xD;
•	Information and data is now found in many forms and under many constraints.&#xD;
•	Boundaries or constraints can include legal, geographic, ownership, sovereignty, language, format, application, technology, security, privacy, etc.; the goal is to architect by considering these boundaries, not to circumvent them.&#xD;
•	Data architecture or lineage and flow must be such that we can utilize, process, and share data regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	Data if possible should reside where it is and not re-created or moved.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property must be respected and maintained regardless of constraints.&#xD;
•	A federated management / stewardship approach may be applied in certain circumstances.&#xD;
•	Availability must not suffer due to insufficiently designed and implemented solutions.&#xD;
•	Third party processing (supply chain security) policies and architectures should be designed and monitored (i.e., our data must be under our rules at all times and locations).&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Common Understanding and Trusted&#xD;
Statement:	Business and program terminology and data are defined consistently throughout the Department, and the definitions and values are understandable, trusted and available to all users.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	A common vocabulary facilitates communications and enables effective dialogue.&#xD;
•	The data that will be used in the development of services must have a common definition throughout the Department to enable sharing of data. &#xD;
•	Information and Data are meaningfully defined from an enterprise perspective by the appropriate authorities, and are obtained from reliable, authoritative and understood data flows and sources. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	The Department must establish the initial common vocabulary for the business based on open standards where available. The definitions will be used uniformly throughout the Department.&#xD;
•	Multiple concurrent definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood by the entire Department.&#xD;
•	Whenever a new definition is required, the definition effort will be co-coordinated and reconciled with the corporate &quot;glossary&quot;. &#xD;
•	Clarity and integrity of information / data is crucial to supporting business processes&#xD;
•	Building trust in data requires a multi-faceted approach.&#xD;
•	Metadata capture and utilisation must be mandatory in all processes and systems&#xD;
•	Data and its associated metadata must be an integral part of any business process design&#xD;
•	Information and data lineage (flow) and applied business rules must be documented and available&#xD;
•	Stewards must clearly define business terms and data elements, aligned to business programs to provide a common enterprise vocabulary, thus allowing for enterprise-wide use and interoperability&#xD;
•	Stewards need a simple and repeatable process to define, have approved and publish definitions and other metadata for information and data elements&#xD;
•	Stewards and all consumers need a repository, tied to important systems to capture / consume metadata &#xD;
•	Stewards will direct custodians in their activities as relates data aspects&#xD;
•	Properly identified data custodians are solely responsible for data capture to ensure integrity and quality and reduce redundant efforts and storage/processing&#xD;
•	Data governance and stewardship provide the means to ensure that enterprise data can be trusted &#xD;
•	Enterprise Information and Data should be located in authoritative sources &#xD;
•	Without trust in data consumers may develop their own siloed and redundant solutions/repositories.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Shared Assets&#xD;
Statement:	Information and Data are Shared Assets.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are valuable enterprise assets, with clear accountability, and treated as ‘our’ data not ‘my’ data to fully deliver on its benefits. &#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Information / Data are enterprise assets, much like capital, human or intellectual property assets.&#xD;
•	Most enterprise assets require careful management, and Information / Data are no exception.&#xD;
•	Information / Data assets exist to respond to business needs, support decision-making, enhance operational efficiencies and provide effective service delivery.&#xD;
•	Ownership resides at the enterprise level or higher, not at the individual or business line level.&#xD;
•	Clearly assigned stewardship is key to managing day-to-day data activities and data quality but requires the authority and the means to do so to ensure authoritative decisions are taken by the right parties.&#xD;
•	Discussion and decision forums and approaches must be inclusive, transparent, holistic and at the enterprise level and no longer strictly by business line or limited scope.&#xD;
•	Value is derived from sharing by reducing the number of authoritative sources, obliging data quality, permitting horizontal use / re-use and aggregation / dissemination to tap into unknown potential, and by allowing faster yet secured access.&#xD;
•	Managing and sharing requires policies, procedures, standards, roles &amp; responsibilities, to govern data management capabilities and a significant cultural change at all enterprise levels.&#xD;
•	Various artefacts and tools such as an enterprise data model and a business glossary will assist with management, communication and sharing in support of the enterprise mandate.&#xD;

Name:	Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are Fit-for-Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Information and Data are suitable and of the appropriate quality for the intended purpose, as defined by the business programs and tested as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Often assumed to be a 100% data quality requirement and not the pragmatic reality.&#xD;
•	Approach should be to get the data ‘right’ for the need, as defined by the responsible party.&#xD;
•	Management and architecture of the information / data must support not only operational needs but also and analytical / research and marketing requirements, otherwise the data has no value in bettering program outcomes.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality must be tested and remediated as close to the source as possible.&#xD;
•	Information and Data quality will degrade over time, even if nothing ‘happens’ to the actual data, therefore validation of its quality must be performed as an ongoing function, not one-time efforts and monitoring and reporting on quality metrics must be part of everyday operations.&#xD;
•	Data quality functional expertise (i.e., center of excellence) can establish a standardised framework and support to business programs in their quality validation processes.&#xD;
•	Dimensions of quality utilised to validate the appropriateness and usefulness of the data will vary by necessity (i.e., uniqueness, validity, completeness, accuracy, etc.).&#xD;
•	Business purpose of data must consider upstream and downstream uses, and not just the immediate use.&#xD;
•	Information and data repositories may need differing levels of quality if utilised for research versus operational needs.&#xD;

•	Information and Data are managed across all data management capabilities and throughout its lifecycle, according to industry standards and best practices, for the purpose of answering current and future business needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Data Management Functional leadership must exist to ensure all aspects of managing information and data are included to cover all facets of business data needs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Buy what we can and build what we must.&#xD;
Statement:&#xD;
Implement cloud services/COTS by default, open source where practical, and reserve custom development for unique requirements; adopt shared services and common government solutions where available.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Procuring commercial solutions (Cloud Services, COTS or open source) for common applications allows ESDC to focus its resources on application with Unique Requirements related specific configurations, customizations, and as a last resort custom development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	When deploying new workloads, Departments must consider cloud service models in the following order:&#xD;
    o	Cloud Services (SaaS)&#xD;
    o	Open source&#xD;
    o	COTS &#xD;
This means that the preference will be given to subscribing to SaaS solutions rather than buying or developing new solutions that can be hosted on a PaaS or IaaS infrastructure.&#xD;
•	When SaaS is not available, ESDC will explore availability of packaged solutions, both commercially available (COTS) and open source. Only if no appropriate solution is available on the market (commercial or open sauce), development of a custom solution would be considered.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions restrict reuse, reduce asset management flexibility and can prevent government organizations from switching suppliers.&#xD;
•	Open source will be fairly assessed against proprietary solutions alternatives. Exit, rebid and rebuild costs will be taken into consideration during procurement decisions for best value for money comparisons between open source and proprietary solutions.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Service Orientation&#xD;
Statement:	The architecture is based on a design of services which mirror real-world business activities comprising the enterprise (or inter-enterprise) business processes.&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Service orientation supports enterprise agility and boundaryless information flow&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Need to think in terms of APIs, application services, and service-based integration that fulfills a  business need&#xD;
•	Service representation utilizes business description to provide context (i.e. business process, goal, rule, policy service interface and service component) and implements services using service orchestration&#xD;
•	Service orientation places unique requirements on the infrastructure; implementations should use open standards to realise interoperability and location transparency.&#xD;
•	Implementations are environment specific; they are constrained by context and must be described within that context.&#xD;
•	Service orientation requires strong governance of service representation and implementation.&#xD;

&#xD;
Name: 	Control Technical  Diversity&#xD;
Statement:	‘Right-size’ the variety of technology platforms to use in alignment with our partners’ strategic choices (i.e. SSC, TBS).&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Limiting the number of different supported technologies:&#xD;
    o	Improves maintainability and reduces total cost of ownership.&#xD;
    o	Enhances staff focus on standardized technologies and reduces staff competency requirements.&#xD;
    o	Improves solution interoperability&#xD;
    o	Improves synergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Consider benefits of introducing a new technology versus the required additional maintenance effort, additional staff competency requirements, increased complexity, and the potential lack of interoperability with existing technologies.&#xD;
•	Balance controlling technical diversity and IT-enabled business innovation.&#xD;
•	Prefer vendor-independent technologies to enable solution interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.&#xD;
•	Reduce integration complexity by utilizing standardized integration approaches.&#xD;
•	Policies, standards, and procedures that govern acquisition of technology must be tied directly to this principle.&#xD;
•	Technology options will be constrained by the choices available within the supported standards. &#xD;
•	Technology options and preferred choices are published as “Technology Bricks” and governed through architecture governance. The “Bricks” are refreshed regularly to reflect appearance of new technologies and sunset of legacy technologies.&#xD;

      <documentation>6.3.	Quality Level Metrics (QLM) Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	QLM Approach&#xD;
Statement:	Technology implementations require quality level metrics (QLM) negotiations and tradeoff discussions to occur as early as possible in the architecture and design process between business stakeholders and systems stakeholders including application architects, technology architects, service providers and operations and maintenance staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Facilitates non-functional requirements gathering &#xD;
•	Avoids narrow discussions of requirements - business stakeholders will have a clearer idea of the system they are asking for / getting &#xD;
•	Better acceptance from the business on the system that is ultimately delivered – fewer surprises for both the business and I&amp;IT &#xD;
•	Better fit of applications into the infrastructure &#xD;
•	Better security&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Need to ensure that processes, such as product selections, vendor of record, planning, requirements gathering, have quality level metrics as part of the requirements. The standard QLMs are:&#xD;
    o	Scalability - The ability of the solution to scale up or down to meet the increase/ decrease in volume through increasing/decreasing the number of nodes/servers supporting the solution (horizontal scaling) or increasing/decreasing the resources of a single node/server  (vertical scaling)&#xD;
    o	Performance - The ability of the solution to meet the load and response time requires&#xD;
    o	Availability  - The ability of the solution to meet recovery time objectives, recovery point objectives and system up time&#xD;
    o	Recoverability - The ability of the solution to transaction recovery\rollback, guarantee atomicity, transactional checkpoint logging and backup&#xD;
    o	Integrity - The accuracy, completeness and timeliness of data at rest or in transit within a solution&#xD;
    o	Interoperability - The degree with which the system can connect to, exchange and process data from other systems.&#xD;
    o	Usability - The ability and extent the solution can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals effectively and efficiently&#xD;
    o	Source-ability - The degree to which equivalent solutions/services/components can be obtained from multiple sources&#xD;
    o	Affordability - The characteristics of a product or service that  provides the government value for money and falls within their budget  through the expected life span of the product or service&#xD;
    o	Supportability - The ease with which the solution can be operated, configured and maintained by the operational staff during the useful life of the solution&#xD;
    o	Adaptiveness / Modifiability-The degree to which a module, component or other work product ban be used in more than one solution.&#xD;
    o	Upgradeability - The ease in which the solution in whole or components of the solutions can be modified to take advantage of new service, solution, software or hardware technologies&#xD;
    o	Security -The ability in which the solution meets the security objectives and standards &#xD;
•	Need to document, publish and enforce the requirement for quality level metrics when developing solutions, services and infrastructure</documentation>

&#xD;
Name:	Security-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Enable and protect activities and assets of both people and enterprises are built-in to any business practice and corresponding IT solution&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	ESDC’s  IM/IT assets are protected against theft, loss, damage, or unauthorized modification, destruction or disclosure to assure public confidence in the Department. &#xD;
•	When security protection for confidentiality, availability and integrity are considered up front., it is more cost effective and results are more robust and resilient.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability must be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought.  &#xD;
•	Security must be designed in the business processes within which an IT system will be used.&#xD;
•	ESDC’s business solutions must be compliant with the Privacy Act; MITS; ATIP policies; FAA, etc.&#xD;
•	Security requirements must be determined with all stakeholders. &#xD;
•	Business driven security requirements based on legislation, policies, and business needs must be supported. &#xD;
•	A consistent, trusted and effective security model must be developed for use across all applications, data, systems, and infrastructure.&#xD;
•	Security Assessment and Audit (SA&amp;A) , and Statement of Sensitivity (SoS) processes shall be used to identify threats and risks and select cost effective controls which meet control objectives. &#xD;
•	A Vulnerability Assessment (VA) process shall be used to identifying and quantifying vulnerabilities in a system. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to have business impact analysis and business continuity planning processes developed and implemented. &#xD;
•	Program managers need to be part of the process to conduct the business impact analysis and to select contingency and business continuity plans. &#xD;
•	Business impact analysis should be coordinated with value/risk analysis to identify potential countermeasures to exposures to the ESDC during the design of new business processes. &#xD;
•	A controlled variance process must be adhered to.&#xD;
•	Accountable parties are responsible for establishing or aligning to authorised purposes for their assets &#xD;
•	Risk tolerances, breach mitigation and breach outcomes must be clearly defined beforehand.&#xD;
•	Ethically and legally, ESDC is obligated to protect Information / Data under its care to retain the right to manage and use it.&#xD;
•	Information / Data are sheltered from unauthorised access, modification, use, disclosure or destruction.&#xD;
•	Intellectual property and confidentiality is safeguarded.&#xD;
•	Sharing must be balanced against classification, proprietariness or sensitivity of Information / Data.&#xD;
•	Aggregation of Information / Data, such as for residual data must also be reviewed for sensitivity.&#xD;
•	Security must be applied at the appropriate level, i.e., data level versus application level.&#xD;
•	Systems and Information / Data must be safeguarded from malevolent intentions and disaster.&#xD;
•	Emerging technologies such as cloud and data lakes, must be accounted for in modernised policies,  standards and practices, and user awareness and training.&#xD;
•	Anonymization or masking techniques may be necessary and utilised before permitting certain access.&#xD;
•	Security controls must not hinder appropriate and timely access and sharing of assets s (e.g.  Information / data).&#xD;
&#xD;
GC Security Architecture &#xD;
•	Information categorization – As the originator of a record, each department is responsible for a plan, the implementation of information categorization systems and the review of data and information prior to release on the Open Government Portal (the “Portal”)&#xD;
•	Should it be third-party information (government to government, government to industry, other), additional release mechanisms are up to department review &#xD;
•	Training and awareness on the requirements of the Portal is needed (to reduce additional work for other departmental stakeholders such as ATIP officer or Privacy analysts)&#xD;
•	Departments are also responsible to review the metadata and telemetry of datasets, to reduce the risk that combining smaller pieces of the data can enable a malicious user to action one of the risk scenarios&#xD;
•	Legal and policy framework – Departments must continue to observe all domestic and international laws as they relate to handling resources, and should be respectful when considering which resources are being shared and released on the Portal&#xD;
•	Respect for privacy and persons – Departments must protect personal information by not releasing it on the Portal&#xD;
•	Departments must ensure that all data and information released on the Portal contains no personal information or is properly de-identified/anonymized&#xD;
•	Departments should be transparent about how data and information will be collected, used and shared on the Portal&#xD;
•	Within an “Open by Default” environment, departments must identify situations and datasets which cannot be released or be made open by design&#xD;
•	Forward planning – Departments should consider privacy and security when releasing records on the Portal.  Considerations should include:&#xD;
•	Consulting internally with business line and data / information owners / stewards to identify risks associated to the public, the organizations and the government as a whole&#xD;
•	Assessing privacy and security on an ongoing basis, as due diligence does not end with uploading a record but rather an ongoing responsibility to maintain the accuracy and completeness of all records&#xD;
•	Making plans prior to the release of records for their maintenance and periodic reviews of the privacy and security implications of the universe of relevant records available on the Portal&#xD;
•	Assigning clear accountabilities within departments and agencies for considering privacy and security implications of open government records&#xD;
•	Security and Privacy Incidents and Remediation – Departments and agencies will take steps to ensure their ability to respond effectively in the case of a privacy or security incident&#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected security incidents, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Departmental Security Management (DDSM), departmental and agency processes and procedures, and when applicable the Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)  &#xD;
•	In the event of any real or suspected privacy breach, departments and agencies will respond in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Practices. Departments and agencies should apprise themselves of TBS Guidelines for Privacy Breaches and the Privacy Breach Management Toolkit.

•	Considerations for maximizing release – When considering de-identifying information and data, the following should be noted:&#xD;
•	De-identification needs to be done by trained officials&#xD;
•	Software for de-identification is not always available and may need to be developed&#xD;
•	Effective de-identification may reduce the granularity of records and, as a result, data and information quality may decrease&#xD;
•	De-identification can be costly and require significant investments of resources, time, and data processing&#xD;
•	Extrapolation or aggregation risks may persist in spite of de-identification efforts&#xD;

&#xD;
Name:	Privacy-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Respect and protect personal information are built-in to any business practice and corresponding IT solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	ESDC’s IM/IT assets are protected against theft, loss, damage, or unauthorized modification, destruction or disclosure in order to assure public confidence in the Department. &#xD;
•	When security is considered up front the result is more cost effective, and the outcome is more robust and resilient security protections for privacy.  &#xD;
•	Information / Data capture, access and usage processes ensure the protection of privacy without impeding or delaying access to it for justified needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications:&#xD;
•	All of the Departments’ business solutions must be compliant with the Privacy Act; MITS; ATIP policies; FAA, etc.&#xD;
•	Privacy requirements must be determined with all stakeholders. &#xD;
•	Effective privacy administration processes and tools for assurance and accountability shall be required. &#xD;
•	A controlled variance process must be adhered to.&#xD;
•	Must align to necessary frameworks, both internal and external as pertains privacy protection (i.e., GDPR, Canadian laws and regulations).&#xD;
•	Automatic processing, trans-border and cross-entity flows of personal data create new forms of relationships among countries/entities and require compatible rules and practices be in place.&#xD;
•	Personal data shall not be transferred to any entity unless that entity ensures an adequate level of protection and authorisation from individuals.&#xD;
•	Current legislation and competing values might be a hurdle to sharing and free flow of private data.&#xD;
•	Data Stewards must aid in removing or avoid creating unjustified barriers to private data.&#xD;
•	We must prepare for breaches to permit a timely and appropriate response and course of action.&#xD;
•	Personal data collection needs and uses must be clearly defined up front.&#xD;
•	Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose. &#xD;
•	Private individuals must have the right and ability to view, edit their information, and the right to be forgotten in certain cases (i.e., data is disposed of at the end of the effective lifecycle of the data or process).&#xD;
•	Automated means of processing private data must be transparent to data subjects.&#xD;
•	Data classification will be necessary in all situations.&#xD;

      <documentation>7.3.	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
&#xD;
Name:	Integrity-by-Design&#xD;
Statement:	Provide clients with a high degree of trust that the system and its attendant data and information are correct (i.e., precise, accurate and meaningful), valid (created, modified and deleted only by authorized users) and invariant (i.e., consistent an unmodified).&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale:&#xD;
•	Integrity is one of the three central pillars of securing corporate information assets along with confidentiality and availability. Integrity keeps data pure and trustworthy by protecting system and data from intentional or accidental changes. &#xD;
•	With data being the primary information asset, integrity provides the assurance that the data is accurate and reliable. Without integrity, the cost of collecting and maintaining the data cannot be justified. Therefore, policies and procedures should support ensuring that data can be trusted.&#xD;
•	Mechanisms put in place to ensure the integrity of the system, its data and information should prevent attacks on the storage of that data (contamination) and on its transmission (interference). Data that is altered on the network between the storage and the user's workstation can be as untrustworthy as the attacker altering or deleting the data on the storage media. Protecting data involves both storage and network mechanisms.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making modifications to data or programs.&#xD;
•	Unauthorized users must be prevented from making improper or unauthorized modifications.&#xD;
•	Internal and external consistency of data and programs must be maintained.&#xD;
•	Applying encryption to information that will be sent over the Internet or stored on digital media.&#xD;
•	Software must be built defensively.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from inadvertently storing inaccurate or invalid data by incorrect data entry, an incorrect decision made in running programs, or not following procedures.&#xD;
•	Users should be prevented from affecting integrity through system configuration errors at their workstations or even by using the wrong programs to access the data.&#xD;
•	Users should be taught about devicde and data integrity during their information security awareness training.&#xD;
•	The installation of any new software or devices must be prevented except when done by a limited set of authorized people. &#xD;
•	Check system integrity against a set of predefined validation policies or standards.&#xD;

      <documentation>1.2.	What are Principles?&#xD;
Architecture principles are a set of statements that inform architecture decisions (e.g. “Doing the Right Thing”) and work (e.g. “Doing EA  Right”). &#xD;
&#xD;
Bizbok and  TOGAF,  define principles as:&#xD;
•	An agreed upon truth that can guide one’s reasoning. (Bizbok 7.5 glossary)&#xD;
•	EA principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission (TOGAF 9.2 Chapter 20.1).&#xD;
To that end the essence of ESDC EA Principles are:&#xD;
•	EA Assement Principles: “Doing the Right Thing” inform architecture decisions to ensure  the department is doing the right thing to acheive its strategic goals and act on its mandate.  &#xD;
•	EA Program Principles: “Doing EA Right”,  inform architure work to ensure architectures are being developed and implemented the correct way.  (e.g TOGAF EA Principles, GC Architectural Standards)&#xD;
&#xD;
In general, the EA Principles are high-level statements of the fundamental values that guide business and IM/IT decision-making. EA Principles the foundation for architectures, policies, standards and processes. Because the EA Principles define a value system, once they are defined and agreed upon, they are not likely to change frequently; however they will be reviewed on an annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
To be effective, EA Principles must be considered as a set, not individually. It is common to have sets of principles form a hierarchy in those more detailed principles are informed by and elaborate on the principles at a higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enterprise Architecture Principles are comprised of:&#xD;
    o	Domain Architecture Principles (Business, Information and Data, Application, Technology, Security &amp; Privacy) &#xD;
    o	Reference Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Security Architecture Principles&#xD;
    o	Solution Architecture Principles&#xD;
        	Design Principles&#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC Enterprise Architecture Principles are informed and constrained by the Government of Canada and the ESDC Service Strategy principles. Employment and Social Development Canada’s Service Strategy Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
1.5.	Value of EA Principles&#xD;
The EA Principles are intended to simplify, not complicate business decisions. They are most valuable in evaluating complex situations with multiple competing goals and where no clear rules or directives have been established. Conformance to the EA Principles as outlined in this document will:&#xD;
•	Optimize business value and departmental benefits realization;&#xD;
•	Provide a framework for assessing and prioritizing changes;&#xD;
•	Allow for change to be accommodated in a less disruptive manner;&#xD;
•	Facilitate the fulfilment of the business requirements;&#xD;
•	Lower the overall life cycle cost of applications;&#xD;
•	Improve the manageability of the architectural components;&#xD;
•	Support an active vs. reactive approach to planning service delivery projects.</documentation>

Government of Canada Digital Standards: Playbook&#xD;
From Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat&#xD;
&#xD;
Improving government services in the Digital Age&#xD;
Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Design With Users" id="id-151c84e68f254fd7a06fc95bbdf8dca5">
      <documentation>Design with users&#xD;
Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design with users&#xD;
Services should not be built based on internal constraints or complexities of government, they should be built to address the needs of users. In order to deliver value to users, one must understand and prioritize their needs. Everything is a hypothesis until tested with the users of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
To validate one's hypotheses, one must validate their assumptions through direct and frequent interactions with those who will be using the services. Users may be members of the public, or government employees or a combination thereof. Keeping in mind that users will come from diverse backgrounds, varying in location, experience, knowledge, and abilities, requirements for services are built first and foremost with the needs of all users. When designing services, one must take a holistic approach to service delivery -- from each member's individual contributions to the end goal, as defined by user requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. End-user feedback is used to establish the requirements of our service(s).&#xD;
2. Our team has processes or tools in place for user feedback, including anonymous user feedback, to be incorporated into the design of the service.&#xD;
3. Our team conducts user research prior to deciding upon a given implementation. &#xD;
4. Our team has tested our primary systems in the users’ context with a wide range of users including users with varying needs and representing diverse backgrounds.&#xD;
5. Our team considers user needs and feedback in defining key service metrics.&#xD;
6. Our team uses automation to anticipate and detect operational or quality-of-service issues before our users tell us.&#xD;
7. Our team has within it, or direct access to, the expertise required to conduct user research and usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team receives requirements through extensive documentation and builds against them.&#xD;
2. Our team does not involve internal or external users to collaborate on the design of the service.&#xD;
3. The technical development resources or IT senior management are prioritizing features.&#xD;
4. Our team's prioritization of tasks is driven by senior management.&#xD;
5. Senior executives and teams rely exclusively on desk-based research, or other proxy sources of information to inform policy, program and/or service design.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Iterate and Improve Frequently" id="id-c14b74450aaf41c9a0fc876c2a9a2237">
      <documentation>Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently&#xD;
In contrast to high risk and long lead time ‘big bang’ deployments, working services must be put in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. Said feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
One sets a north star to define a clear direction, then begins iterating towards this north star, keeping in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments to be made along the way. By leveraging modern technologies and modern approaches to working, risk can be reduced by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency. Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible, rather than increase risk by creating prolonged processes that use documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. There are processes in place to prioritize and implement feedback from peers, stakeholders and end-users.&#xD;
2. When a new or updated service or feature is being created our team understands the minimum requirements for the system to be of value to users.&#xD;
3. Our team experiments with new approaches based on team reflections, lessons learned, and user feedback.&#xD;
4. Our team collects metrics to improve upon which are used throughout the development and lifecycle of the service.&#xD;
5. When resolving problems our team dedicates time to identify the root cause of the issue and address it.&#xD;
6. Our team is relentlessly inspecting, adapting, and automating their processes to increase the speed at which our team can deliver value to users.&#xD;
7. Our team has access to environments and resources to allow for rapid prototyping while initial requirements are being sought.&#xD;
8. Our team embraces learning about and using new digital skills, approaches, and tools to incorporate into our daily work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team only shares their work once it has been finalized and approved.&#xD;
2. Decisions regarding the direction of our team are made without reference to any collected performance metrics.&#xD;
3. Our team identifies solutions before it is clear what outcomes our team is working towards and how to measure them.&#xD;
4. Processes are rarely, if ever, reviewed to find and implement efficiencies.&#xD;
5. Our team must wait for the project to be approved and funded prior to environments being made available to teams to begin experimenting with solutions.&#xD;
6. Our team fully architects the end to the service delivery solution prior to starting to build.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Work In The Open By Default" id="id-132db1f93aea46f79825793243c21c6c">
      <documentation>Work in the open by default&#xD;
Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Work in the open by default&#xD;
Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government. Working in the open promotes understanding of government processes and services and creates an environment whereby innovation can take place throughout the Government of Canada and through non-governmental organizations leveraging the government data and information to improve service delivery for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
This way of working aligns Canada with the Digital Nations Charter, of which it is a signatory and promotes “transparency and citizen participation and uses open licences to produce and consume open data”, and the Open Data Charter. Further, by working in the open the Government of Canada can increase its reuse of existing public solutions and allow others to reuse work conducted by the Government of Canada. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Teams continually makes all non-sensitive and non-personal data, information, and new code publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, for sharing and reuse.&#xD;
2. Our team contributes back to the public projects from which they borrow content.&#xD;
3. Our team tracks and makes public the metrics upon which our team measures its success.&#xD;
4. Our team tracks, and makes publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, information regarding how often a change to our services fails (e.g., the deployment or rollout of a service or feature experiences issues or complications).&#xD;
5. Our team makes visual displays which show what they’re working on and the status of their work available publicly, or at least throughout the Government of Canada.&#xD;
6. Our team publicly documents, including examples of reuse, how others can use their service’s APIs, open data, or information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. All of the team's work is done on systems behind the corporate firewall.&#xD;
2. The work of our team has permissions set so that only members of our team can access the team's work.&#xD;
3. Our team does not contribute to, or collaborate on, work being done by our colleagues.&#xD;
4. Team applies blanket security classification for the digital system to all data stored by the application.&#xD;
5. Our team has no process by which to declassify and release records when they are no longer protected or classified.&#xD;
6. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.</documentation>

      <documentation>Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Use open standards and solutions&#xD;
To maintain the trust of Canadians, the government must continually learn and improve by embracing leading practices to simplify access to government services to match the rising expectations of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
In alignment with the Digital Nations Charter, which calls for both the use of Open Standards and Open Source, this Digital Standard aligns with the ultimate Digital Vision which reads, “The Government of Canada is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.” By leveraging open source software, and leveraging open standards and solutions, the Government of Canada can mitigate vendor lock-in and expand its vendor pool from which to acquire digital services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team prioritizes solutions using open standards over solutions that do not.&#xD;
2. Team members give back to the open source community as active contributors.&#xD;
3. Our team designs their services to be interoperable with other services.&#xD;
4. When searching for a new product, service or solution, our team considers open source solutions.&#xD;
5. Our team supports clients using any device, from anywhere and at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team renews existing contracts with vendors without first investigating open source tooling.&#xD;
2. Our team does not have the competencies within it to deliver its services without the help of consultants or closed source vendor software.</documentation>

      <documentation>Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Address security and privacy risks&#xD;
Digital services are core to service delivery, and they must securely store and manage the information of Canadians to maintain trust in government services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy should be taken as a consideration from the onset of work for a given service, in alignment with Iterate and Improve. The implementation of security and privacy controls should be considered part of daily work. Similarly, processes should promote and monitor the continuous implementation of security and privacy controls throughout the lifecycle of a service. This will demonstrably increase the security and privacy posture of digital services by leveraging automated testing and real time reporting and monitoring over anecdotal document-heavy manual processes. Said processes, and the security and privacy controls themselves, should be frictionless, ensuring that services are designed first and foremost for users, not to satisfy existing legacy government procedures, tooling, or processes. Furthermore, by creating frictionless processes and permitting services to be iterated and improved upon quickly, the government is better situated to respond quickly to security or privacy risk. By responding to these operational needs within hours or minutes rather than months, the government can improve its security and privacy posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team considers security and privacy throughout the service design process.&#xD;
2. When implementing or enforcing security or privacy controls, our team takes into consideration how they would impact the quality or efficiency of the service and how it will impact the end users of the service.&#xD;
3. Security measures are frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.&#xD;
4. Our team has privacy and security knowledge and understanding as a competency within the team.&#xD;
5. The service has implemented automated security checks and privacy protections include role-based access and audit functions against the service.&#xD;
6. There are procedures and processes in place to quickly respond to security or privacy breaches or incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team has no internal privacy or security knowledge, relying on other teams to identify nearly all security or privacy controls and best practices.&#xD;
2. The core services upon which our team works have no automated security checks or privacy protections.&#xD;
3. Our team relies on security through obscurity, hiding services or information rather than improving the security posture of the service.&#xD;
4. Our team implements or enforces security or privacy controls without considering the impact on service usability.</documentation>

Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Build in accessibility from the start&#xD;
Quality should be built in from the start, preventing the need to revisit previously implemented components due to issues, such as accessibility. The faster and earlier issues are found the less costly they are to fix.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accessibility in Canada is about creating communities, workplaces and services that enable everyone to participate fully in society without barriers. The Government of Canada is committed to taking a proactive and systemic approach for identifying, removing and preventing barriers to accessibility without delay complementing the rights of persons with disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act. To meet these commitments, accessibility should be a consideration throughout the service development lifecycle. This requires that accessibility be monitored and built into our processes to continually promote alignment with accessibility standards. While iterating and improving frequently and designing with users, accessibility should be a key consideration, and become a source of work items throughout the service design lifecycle. When designing with users, efforts should be made to identify a wide variety of users with a wide variety of needs, to ensure accessibility standards are met or exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Starting at the outset, our team's service and platform design continually considers the lowest levels of digital skill, confidence and access.&#xD;
2. Our team understands how to make their services or products accessible.&#xD;
3. Our team considers accessibility throughout the service design process.&#xD;
4. Research and testing are conducted to ensure our service is accessible to people of all abilities no matter how, where, or when they access the service.&#xD;
5. Our team conducts ongoing user research with users with low level digital literacy, people with disability, and people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.&#xD;
6. Our team implements automated accessibility checks for our services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team has no competency with accessibility and relies on another team to identify accessibility shortcomings.&#xD;
2. Accessibility compliance is added at the end of the development cycle in order to pass compliance checks or audits.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Empower Staff to Deliver Better Services" id="id-35ab47d9ff9d41f49e7369f8e71e3d9e">
      <documentation>Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services&#xD;
To promote innovation and create agility within our organizations the teams that makeup our organizations must be empowered. Innovation increasingly flows from the bottom up rather than from the top down, and to benefit from this trend teams must be empowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don’t hire good people to tell them what to do, hire good people to have them tell you what to do. The government manages large, highly complex and crucially important services for their users. A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users, or based on the expertise of those building the services. Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem, are those closest to the problem. By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes. To create organizations that can iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. Complex architectures that are responsive to the needs of users, including users within the organization, are emergent and are not derived through the compilation of hypotheses lacking the expertise of those closest to the complex problems needing to be solved. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Team members self-organize and self-manage through self-assigning tasks.&#xD;
2. Team members meet with liberty to openly discuss challenges without fear of blame or reproach.&#xD;
3. Team members feel safe to challenge the status quo.&#xD;
4. Our team values learning as part of daily work.&#xD;
5. Team members can articulate how their work contributes to business outcomes.&#xD;
6. Our team can choose the tools they use to deliver their service.&#xD;
7. Our team's management actively removes impediments that prevent the team from focusing on delivering value.&#xD;
8. Our team has access to environments to experiment with new approaches, tooling, or solutions.&#xD;
9. Our team feels their feedback is valued.&#xD;
10. Failures are treated in our team as opportunities to improve and learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Work is assigned directly to members of our team from management.&#xD;
2. Our team is required to get a series of approvals prior to being able to make routine changes to their service.&#xD;
3. Learning in our team is largely done through week or day long courses periodically throughout the year.&#xD;
4. Our team is unable, or finds it difficult, to acquire productivity tooling.&#xD;
5. Our team does not have access to Software as a Service (SaaS) productivity tools as they are blocked by the department.&#xD;
6. On our team, learning through reading books, blogs, or watching videos, talks, or tutorials is not viewed as work.&#xD;
7. Our team has restricted access to tools, training and software based on job classification.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Be Good Data Stewards" id="id-9f84299755144f8a8aa55f75e9fa4cb3">
      <documentation>Be good data stewards&#xD;
Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Be good data stewards&#xD;
Good data stewardship is required to ensure data is clean, reusable, and managed responsibly to be leveraged for data driven decision making and promote reuse of information rather than duplication of efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
This involves managing data and information responsibly and securely, which supports the sharing and reuse of data throughout the Government of Canada and through promoting its use through innovative new solutions within the private sector. In alignment with working in the open by default, data and information should be published to be readable, by humans or by machines by publishing well organized data in machine readable formats. In alignment with iterating and improving frequently, efforts should be made to continually improve the quality of the data, and the quality of the processes used to manage and publish said data. Further, by working in the open by default and properly managing data and information sources, issues such as duplication of data and information and rework can be mitigated, while promoting the creation of innovative solutions which are able to leverage information collected and published by the government. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team strives to leverage data to continuously improve decision-making, operations, or service delivery.&#xD;
2. Our team identifies what data is needed to support decision-making, operations, or service delivery and reuses existing data as appropriate before acquiring new data.&#xD;
3. Our team strives to identify and remove barriers to data sharing and release.&#xD;
4. Our team ensures that users of our services can make corrections to their personal information.&#xD;
5. Our team publishes data and information on the open government portal.&#xD;
6. Our team publishes data in plain language and machine-readable formats.&#xD;
7. Our team has clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for data and information management and use.&#xD;
8. Our team captures appropriate metadata to provide context for the information and data we create and capture, thereby enabling its discovery and reuse by others.&#xD;
9. Our team has processes in place to regularly assess, maintain, and improve data quality.&#xD;
10. Our service has in place processes for ensuring proper management of information and data prior to being collected, used, disclosed, retained, disposed of, or declassified.&#xD;
11. Our team ensures that information and data of business value are saved in systems where it can be properly managed.&#xD;
12. Our team has processes in place for determining the classification of data and information.&#xD;
13. Our team is aware of which information and data has business value and prioritizes its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team, or the service our team manages, asks users for the same information more than once.&#xD;
2. The service, or services, our team is responsible for collects all the data or information required without reusing existing data or information.&#xD;
3. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.&#xD;
4. Our team does not have the data it needs to make informed policy, program, or service decisions.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Design Ethical Services" id="id-995cec790f0b4ad1a13f2207a4dfe5b8">
      <documentation>Design ethical services&#xD;
Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Design ethical services&#xD;
Designing ethical systems means that systems created by the government ensures that everyone receives equitable treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Services should address client needs and provide public benefits. In the digital age, the underlying systems that run Canada’s services come to conclusions that can be opaque to both the external users, and those managing the systems. Efforts are required to increase the transparency and address potential biases of computational decisions, and to ensure that decisions made or supported using these systems are legal, consistent, accurate and align with the expectations and intents of those managing them. The responsible use of automated-decision systems includes being open about their use and being able to explain how decisions are made. Through iterative service design where results are continuously monitored against expected and desired outcomes, the organization positions itself to ensure it is designing ethical services. Furthermore, with extensive monitoring solutions, one must ensure their services are not enforcing biases, whether conscious or unconscious. &#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team continually seeks out indicators of bias and ensures their services are not reinforcing unintended biases.&#xD;
2. Our team continually seeks out evidence of unintended consequences to the user in service design and delivery and works to mitigate these consequences for the user.&#xD;
3. When automated decision-making is being leveraged by our team, possible biases in the data and algorithms are acknowledged, accounted for, and mitigated.&#xD;
4. Our team designs services which address cultural, linguistic, geographical, disability, technological, socioeconomic, or other access barriers to uptake.&#xD;
5. Our team has considered the impacts of decisions on the users and negative outcomes are reduced, when encountered.&#xD;
6. Our team uses data in a manner consistent with the purpose of its collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. No training is provided to our team regarding the potential impacts of the service they are designing or delivering.&#xD;
2. Our team conducts little to no monitoring of outcomes of the service to identify implicit bias.&#xD;
3. Our team delegates ethical analysis to a vendor or external service, without direct accountability to management.&#xD;
4. Our team designs and deliver services without fully considering relevant legislation&#xD;
5. Our team delivers services without assessing the impacts of negative outcomes.</documentation>

      <documentation>Collaborate widely&#xD;
Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Guidance: Collaborate widely&#xD;
Collaborating widely allows us to learn from others to minimize mistakes already experienced and reduces work through identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique amongst governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar vendors, are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing a service, or implementing a service using tools or systems, identify which other departments, jurisdictions, or organizations, have leveraged similar technologies to solve similar use cases in order to collaborate widely, reduce work, share solutions, and benefit from lessons already learned by others. Furthermore, using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of staff, the government improves its posture to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time through the overreliance on functionally based teams. Going forward, working across skill sets, and leveraging work from others, while learning from their lessons, promotes the development of modern services better able to meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team is multidisciplinary, having all the skills and capabilities required to fully deliver our service to users.&#xD;
2. Our team is active in communities of practice, events, or groups that pertain to the areas of expertise of team members.&#xD;
3. Our team has identified, and collaborates with, other teams, in or outside of our organisation, including other levels of government, other governments, the public, or private sector organizations, who have done, or are doing, similar work.&#xD;
4. Our team documents any APIs for our service using modern and common protocols and standards and provides examples to others regarding their use.&#xD;
5. Our team uses data from performance monitoring tools to inform business decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Misaligned Behaviours&#xD;
1. Our team develops most of the service on our own, without leveraging existing solutions and services to reduce duplication of effort.&#xD;
2. Our team overwhelmingly relies on tickets to manage collaboration between internal stakeholders or teams.&#xD;
3. The team does not consider the impacts on teams working across the value stream, or on the outcome of the service.</documentation>

      <documentation>Part A Conformance Applicability Notes:&#xD;
Scope of &quot;authoring tool user interface&quot;: The Part A success criteria apply to all aspects of the authoring tool user interface that are concerned with producing the &quot;included&quot; web content technologies. This includes views of the web content being edited and features that are independent of the content being edited (e.g. menus, button bars, status bars, user preferences, documentation).&#xD;
Reflected content accessibility problems: The authoring tool is responsible for ensuring that editing-views display the web content being edited in a way that is more accessible to authors with disabilities (e.g. ensuring that text alternatives in the content can be programmatically determined). However, where an authoring tool user interface accessibility problem is caused directly by the content being edited (e.g. if an image in the content lacks a text alternative), then this would not be considered a deficiency in the accessibility of the authoring tool user interface.&#xD;
Developer control: The Part A success criteria only apply to the authoring tool user interface as it is provided by the developer. They do not apply to any subsequent modifications by parties other than the authoring tool developer (e.g. user modifications of default settings, third-party plug-ins).&#xD;
User agent features: Web-based authoring tools may rely on user agent features (e.g. keyboard navigation, find functions, display preferences, undo features) to satisfy success criteria. Conformance claims are optional, but any claim that is made must record the user agent(s).&#xD;
Accessibility of features provided to meet Part A: The Part A success criteria apply to the entire authoring tool user interface, including any features added to meet the success criteria in Part A (e.g. documentation, search functions). The only exemption is for preview features, as long as they meet the relevant success criteria in Guideline A.3.7. Previews are treated differently than editing-views because all authors, including those with disabilities, benefit when preview features accurately reflect the functionality of user agents that are actually in use by end users.&#xD;
Unrecognizable content: When success criteria require authoring tools to treat web content according to semantic criteria, the success criteria only apply when these semantics are encoded programmatically (e.g. text describing an image can only be considered a text alternatives for non-text content when this role is encoded within markup).</documentation>

&#xD;
A.4.2.1 Describe Accessibility Features: For each authoring tool feature that is used to meet Part A of ATAG 2.0, at least one of the following is true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) Described in the Documentation: Use of the feature is explained in the authoring tool's documentation; or&#xD;
(b) Described in the Interface: Use of the feature is explained in the authoring tool user interface; or&#xD;
(c) Platform Service: The feature is a service provided by an underlying platform; or&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide keyboard access to authoring features. [Implementing A.3.1]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors with limited mobility or visual disabilities do not use a mouse and instead require keyboard interface access to all of the functionality of the authoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.1.1 Keyboard Access (Minimum): All functionality of the authoring tool is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)&#xD;
Note 1: Keyboard interfaces are programmatic services provided by many platforms that allow operation in a device independent manner. This success criterion does not imply the presence of a hardware keyboard.&#xD;
Note 2: The path exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input, but the underlying function (text input) does not. The path exception encompasses other input variables that are continuously sampled from pointing devices, including pressure, speed, and angle.&#xD;
Note 3: This success criterion does not forbid and should not discourage other input methods (e.g. mouse, touch) in addition to keyboard operation.&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.1&#xD;
A.3.1.2 No Keyboard Traps: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface. If it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, authors are advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.2&#xD;
A.3.1.3 Efficient Keyboard Access: The authoring tool user interface includes mechanisms to make keyboard access more efficient than sequential keyboard access. (Level AA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.3&#xD;
A.3.1.4 Keyboard Access (Enhanced): All functionality of the authoring tool is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.4&#xD;
A.3.1.5 Customize Keyboard Access: If the authoring tool includes keyboard commands, then those keyboard commands can be customized. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.1.5&#xD;
A.3.1.6 Present Keyboard Commands: If the authoring tool includes keyboard commands, then the authoring tool provides a way for authors to determine the keyboard commands associated with authoring tool user interface components. (Level AAA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide authors with enough time. &#xD;
[Implementing A.3.2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a32&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors who have difficulty typing, operating the mouse, or processing information can be prevented from using systems with short time limits or that require fast reaction speeds, such as clicking on a moving target.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.2.1 Auto-Save (Minimum): The authoring tool does not include session time limits or the authoring tool can automatically save edits made before the session time limits are reached. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.1&#xD;
A.3.2.2 Timing Adjustable: The authoring tool does not include time limits or at least one of the following is true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) Turn Off: Authors are allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or&#xD;
(b) Adjust: Authors are allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or&#xD;
(c) Extend: Authors are warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (e.g. &quot;press the space bar&quot;), and authors are allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or&#xD;
(d) Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (e.g. a collaborative authoring system), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or&#xD;
(e) Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or&#xD;
(f) 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.2&#xD;
A.3.2.3 Static Input Components: The authoring tool does not include moving user interface components that accept input where the movement of these components cannot be paused by authors. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.2.3&#xD;
A.3.2.4 Content Edits Saved (Extended): The authoring tool can be set to automatically save web content edits made using the authoring tool. (Level AAA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.4: (For the authoring tool user interface) Enhance navigation and editing via content structure. [Implementing A.3.4]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors who have difficulty typing or operating the mouse benefit when authoring tools make use of the structure present in web content to simplify navigating and editing the content.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.4.1 Navigate By Structure: If editing-views expose the markup elements in the web content being edited, then the markup elements (e.g. source code, content renderings) are selectable and navigation mechanisms are provided to move the selection focus between elements. (Level AA)&#xD;
Implementing A.3.4.1&#xD;
A.3.4.2 Navigate by Programmatic Relationships: If editing-views allow editing of programmatic relationships within web content, then mechanisms are provided that support navigation between the related content. (Level AAA)&#xD;
Note: Depending on the web content technology and the nature of the authoring tool, relationships may include, but are not limited to, element nesting, headings, labeling, programmatic definitions, and ID relationships.&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.5: (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide text search of the content. [Implementing A.3.5]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors who have difficulty typing or operating the mouse benefit from the ability to use text search to navigate to arbitrary points within the web content being edited.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.5.1 Text Search: If the authoring tool provides an editing-view of text-based content, then the editing-view enables text search, such that all of the following are true: (Level AA)&#xD;
(a) All Editable Text: Any text content that is editable by the editing-view is searchable (including alternative content); and&#xD;
(b) Match: Matching results can be presented to authors and given focus; and&#xD;
(c) No Match: Authors are informed when no results are found; and&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.6: (For the authoring tool user interface) Manage preference settings. [Implementing A.3.6]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors need to set their own display settings in a way that differs from the presentation that they want to define for the published web content. Providing the ability to save and reload sets of keyboard and display preference settings benefits authors who have needs that differ over time (e.g. due to fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.6.1 Independence of Display: If the authoring tool includes display settings for editing-views, then the authoring tool allows authors to adjust these settings without modifying the web content being edited. (Level A)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents. [Implementing A.3.7]&#xD;
Rationale: Preview features are provided by many authoring tools because the workflow of authors often includes periodically checking how user agents will display the web content to end users. Authors with disabilities need the same opportunity to check their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.3.7.1 Preview (Minimum): If a preview is provided, then at least one of the following is true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) In-Market User Agent: The preview renders content using a user agent that is in-market; or&#xD;
(b) UAAG (Level A): The preview conforms to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Level A [UAAG10].&#xD;

[Implementing A.2.1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a21&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors require access to alternative content in order to interact with the web content that they are editing.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.2.1.1 Text Alternatives for Rendered Non-Text Content: If an editing-view renders non-text content, then any programmatically associated text alternatives for the non-text content can be programmatically determined. (Level A)&#xD;

[Implementing A.2.2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a22&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors need access to details about the editing-view presentation, via their assistive technology, when that presentation is used to convey status messages (e.g. underlining misspelled words) or provide information about how the end user will experience the web content being edited.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.2.2.1 Editing-View Status Indicators: If an editing-view adds status indicators to the content being edited, then the information being conveyed by the status indicators can be programmatically determined. (Level A)&#xD;
Note: Status indicators may indicate errors (e.g. spelling errors), tracked changes, hidden elements, or other information.&#xD;

      <documentation>Part B: Support the production of accessible content&#xD;
Part B Conformance Applicability Notes:&#xD;
Author availability: Any Part B success criteria that refer to authors only apply during authoring sessions.&#xD;
Developer control: The Part B success criteria only apply to the authoring tool as it is provided by the developer. This does not include subsequent modifications by parties other than the authoring tool developer (e.g. third-party plug-ins, user-defined templates, user modifications of default settings).&#xD;
Applicability after the end of an authoring session: Authoring tools are responsible for the web content accessibility (WCAG) of web content that they automatically generate after the end of an author's authoring session (see Success Criterion B.1.1.1). For example, if the developer changes the site-wide templates of a content management system, these would be required to meet the accessibility requirements for automatically-generated content. Authoring tools are not responsible for changes to the accessibility of content that the author causes, whether it is author-generated or automatically-generated by another system that the author has specified (e.g. a third-party feed).&#xD;
Authoring systems: As per the ATAG 2.0 definition of authoring tool, several software tools (identified in any conformance claim) can be used in conjunction to meet the requirements of Part B (e.g. an authoring tool could make use of a third-party software accessibility checking tool).&#xD;
Accessibility of features provided to meet Part B: The Part A success criteria apply to the entire authoring tool user interface, including any features that must be present to meet the success criteria in Part B (e.g. checking tools, repair tools, tutorials, documentation).&#xD;
Multiple authoring roles: Some authoring tools include multiple author roles, each with different views and content editing permissions (e.g. a content management system may separate the roles of designers, content authors, and quality assurers). In these cases, the Part B success criteria apply to the authoring tool as a whole, not to the view provided to any particular authoring role. Accessible content support features should be made available to any authoring role where it would be useful.&#xD;
Unrecognizable content: When success criteria require authoring tools to treat web content according to semantic criteria, the success criteria only apply when these semantics are encoded programmatically (e.g. text describing an image can only be considered a text alternatives for non-text content when this role is encoded within markup).</documentation>

      <documentation>Guideline B.3.1: Assist authors in checking for accessibility problems. [Implementing B.3.1]&#xD;
Rationale: When accessibility checking is an integrated function of the authoring tool, it helps make authors aware of web content accessibility problems (WCAG) during the authoring process, so they can be immediately addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.3.1.1 Checking Assistance (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides authors with the ability to add or modify web content in such a way that a WCAG 2.0 success criterion can be violated, then accessibility checking for that success criterion is provided (e.g. an HTML authoring tool that inserts images should check for alternative text; a video authoring tool with the ability to edit text tracks should check for captions). (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: Automated and semi-automated checking is possible (and encouraged) for many types of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual checking is the minimum requirement to meet this success criterion. In manual checking, the authoring tool provides authors with instructions for detecting problems, which authors carry out by themselves. For more information on checking, see Implementing ATAG 2.0 - Appendix B: Levels of Checking Automation.&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.1&#xD;
B.3.1.2 Help Authors Decide: If the authoring tool provides accessibility checking that relies on authors to decide whether potential web content accessibility problems (WCAG) are correctly identified (i.e. manual checking and semi-automated checking), then the accessibility checking process provides instructions that describe how to decide. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.2&#xD;
B.3.1.3 Help Authors Locate: If the authoring tool provides checks that require authors to decide whether a potential web content accessibility problem (WCAG) is correctly identified (i.e. manual checking and semi-automated checking), then the relevant content is identified to the authors. (Level A)&#xD;
Note: Depending on the nature of the editing-view and the scope of the potential web content accessibility problem (WCAG), identification might involve highlighting elements or renderings of elements, displaying line numbers, or providing instructions.&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.3&#xD;
B.3.1.4 Status Report: If the authoring tool provides checks, then authors can receive an accessibility status report based on the results of the accessibility checks. (Level AA)&#xD;
Note: The format of the accessibility status report is not specified and they might include a listing of problems detected or a WCAG 2.0 conformance level, etc.&#xD;
Implementing B.3.1.4&#xD;
B.3.1.5 Programmatic Association of Results: If the authoring tool provides checks, then the authoring tool can programmatically associate accessibility checking results with the web content that was checked. (Level AA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.3.2: Assist authors in repairing accessibility problems. [Implementing B.2.3]&#xD;
Rationale: When repair is an integral part of the authoring process, it greatly enhances the utility of checking and increases the likelihood that web content accessibility problems (WCAG) will be properly addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.3.2.1 Repair Assistance (WCAG): If checking (see Success Criterion B.3.1.1) can detect that a WCAG 2.0 success criterion is not met, then repair suggestion(s) are provided: (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: Automated and semi-automated repair is possible (and encouraged) for many types of web content accessibility problems (WCAG). However, manual repair is the minimum requirement to meet this success criterion.

      <documentation>Guideline B.1.1: Ensure that automatically-specified content is accessible. [Implementing B.1.1]&#xD;
Rationale: If authoring tools automatically produce web content that includes accessibility problems (WCAG), then this will impose additional repair tasks on authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.1.1.1 Content Auto-Generation After Authoring Sessions (WCAG): The authoring tool does not automatically generate web content after the end of an authoring session, or, authors can specify that the content be accessible web content (WCAG). (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: This success criterion applies only to automatic processes specified by the authoring tool developer. It does not apply when author actions prevent generation of accessible web content (WCAG).&#xD;
Implementing B.1.1.1&#xD;
B.1.1.2 Content Auto-Generation During Authoring Sessions (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides the functionality for automatically generating web content during an authoring session, then at least one of the following is true: (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
(a) Accessible: The content is accessible web content (WCAG) without author input; or&#xD;
(b) Prompting: During the automatic generation process, authors are prompted for any required accessibility information (WCAG); or&#xD;
(c) Automatic Checking: After the automatic generation process, accessibility checking is automatically performed; or&#xD;
(d) Checking Suggested: After the automatic generation process, the authoring tool prompts authors to perform accessibility checking.&#xD;
Note 1: Automatic generation includes automatically selecting templates for authors.&#xD;
Note 2: This success criterion applies only to automatic processes specified by the authoring tool developer. It does not apply when author actions prevent generation of accessible web content (WCAG).&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.1.2: Ensure that accessibility information is preserved. [Implementing B.1.2]&#xD;
Rationale: Accessibility information (WCAG) is critical to maintaining comparable levels of web content accessibility (WCAG) between the input and output of web content transformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.1.2.1 Restructuring and Recoding Transformations (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides restructuring transformations or re-coding transformations, and if equivalent mechanisms exist in the web content technology of the output, then at least one of the following is true: (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
(a) Preserve: Accessibility information (WCAG) is preserved in the output; or&#xD;
(b) Warning: Authors have the default option to be warned that accessibility information (WCAG) may be lost (e.g. when saving a vector graphic into a raster image format); or&#xD;
(c) Automatic Checking: After the transformation, accessibility checking is automatically performed; or&#xD;
(d) Checking Suggested: After the transformation, the authoring tool prompts authors to perform accessibility checking.&#xD;
Note 1: For text alternatives for non-text content, see Success Criterion B.1.2.4.&#xD;
Note 2: This success criteria only applies when the output technology is &quot;included&quot; for conformance.&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.1&#xD;
B.1.2.2 Copy-Paste Inside Authoring Tool (WCAG): If the authoring tool supports copy and paste of structured content, then any accessibility information (WCAG) in the copied content is preserved when the authoring tool is both the source and destination of the copy-paste and the source and destination use the same web content technology. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.2&#xD;
B.1.2.3 Optimizations Preserve Accessibility: If the authoring tool provides optimizing web content transformations, then any accessibility information (WCAG) in the input is preserved in the output. (Level A).&#xD;
Implementing B.1.2.3&#xD;
B.1.2.4 Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content are Preserved: If the authoring tool provides web content transformations that preserve non-text content in the output, then any text alternatives for that non-text content are also preserved, if equivalent mechanisms exist in the web content technology of the output. (Level A).&#xD;
Note: This success criterion only applies when the output technology is &quot;included&quot; for conformance.&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.2.1: Ensure that accessible content production is possible. [Implementing B.2.1]&#xD;
Rationale: To support accessible web content (WCAG) production, at minimum, it is possible to produce web content that conforms with WCAG 2.0 using the authoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.1.1 Accessible Content Possible (WCAG): The authoring tool does not place restrictions on the web content that authors can specify or those restrictions do not prevent WCAG 2.0 success criteria from being met. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.2.2: Guide authors to produce accessible content. [Implementing B.2.2]&#xD;
Rationale: By guiding authors from the outset toward the creation and maintenance of accessible web content (WCAG), web content accessibility problems (WCAG) are mitigated and less repair effort is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.2.1 Accessible Option Prominence (WCAG): If authors are provided with a choice of authoring actions for achieving the same authoring outcome (e.g. styling text), then options that will result in accessible web content (WCAG) are at least as prominent as options that will not. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Implementing B.2.2.1&#xD;
B.2.2.2 Setting Accessibility Properties (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides mechanisms to set web content properties (e.g. attribute values), then mechanisms are also provided to set web content properties related to accessibility information (WCAG). (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: For the prominence of the mechanisms, see Success Criterion B.4.1.4.&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.2.3: Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content. [Implementing B.2.3]&#xD;
Rationale: Improperly generated alternative content can create web content accessibility problems (WCAG) and interfere with accessibility checking.&#xD;
Note: This guideline only applies when non-text content is specified by authors (e.g. inserting an image). When non-text content is automatically added by the authoring tool, see Guideline B.1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.3.1 Alternative Content is Editable (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides functionality for adding non-text content, then authors are able to modify programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Note: An exception can be made when the non-text content is known to be decoration, formatting, invisible or a CAPTCHA.&#xD;
Implementing B.2.3.1&#xD;
B.2.3.2 Automating Repair of Text Alternatives: The authoring tool does not attempt to repair text alternatives for non-text content or the following are all true: (Level A)&#xD;
(a) No Generic or Irrelevant Strings: Generic strings (e.g. &quot;image&quot;) and irrelevant strings (e.g. the file name, file format) are not used as text alternatives; and&#xD;
(b) In-Session Repairs: If the repair attempt occurs during an authoring session, authors have the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair attempt prior to insertion of the text alternative into the content; and&#xD;
(c) Out-of-Session Repairs: If the repair attempt occurs after an authoring session has ended, the repaired text alternatives are indicated during subsequent authoring sessions (if any) and authors have the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair strings prior to insertion in the content.&#xD;
Implementing B.2.3.2&#xD;
B.2.3.3 Save for Reuse: If the authoring tool provides the functionality for adding non-text content, when authors enter programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content, then both of the following are true: (Level AAA)&#xD;
(a) Save and Suggest: The text alternatives are automatically saved and suggested by the authoring tool, if the same non-text content is reused; and&#xD;
(b) Edit Option: The author has the option to edit or delete the saved text alternatives.&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.2.4: Assist authors with accessible templates. [Implementing B.2.4]&#xD;
Rationale: Providing accessible templates (WCAG) can have several benefits, including: immediately improving the accessibility of the web content (WCAG) of being edited, reducing the effort required of authors, and demonstrating the importance of accessible web content (WCAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.4.1 Accessible Template Options (WCAG): If the authoring tool provides templates, then there are accessible template (WCAG) options for a range of template uses. (Level A to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria; Level AA to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria; Level AAA to meet all WCAG 2.0 success criteria)&#xD;
Implementing B.2.4.1&#xD;
B.2.4.2 Identify Template Accessibility: If the authoring tool includes a template selection mechanism and provides any non-accessible template (WCAG) options, then the template selection mechanism can display distinctions between the accessible and non-accessible options. (Level AA)&#xD;
Note: The distinction can involve providing information for the accessible templates, the non-accessible templates or both.&#xD;
Implementing B.2.4.2&#xD;
B.2.4.3 Author-Created Templates: If the authoring tool includes a template selection mechanism and allows authors to create new non-accessible templates (WCAG), then authors can enable the template selection mechanism to display distinctions between accessible and non-accessible templates that they create. (Level AA)&#xD;
Note: The distinction can involve providing information for the accessible templates (WCAG), the non-accessible templates or both.&#xD;
Implementing B.2.4.3&#xD;
B.2.4.4 Accessible Template Options (Enhanced): If the authoring tool provides templates, then all of the templates are accessible template (to WCAG Level AA). (Level AAA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.2.5: Assist authors with accessible pre-authored content. [Implementing B.2.5]&#xD;
Rationale: Providing accessible pre-authored content (WCAG) (e.g. clip art, synchronized media, widgets) can have several benefits, including: immediately improving the accessibility of web content (WCAG) being edited, reducing the effort required of authors, and demonstrating the importance of accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.2.5.1 Accessible Pre-Authored Content Options: If the authoring tool provides pre-authored content, then a range of accessible pre-authored content (to WCAG Level AA) options are provided. (Level AA)&#xD;
Implementing B.2.5.1&#xD;
B.2.5.2 Identify Pre-Authored Content Accessibility: If the authoring tool includes a pre-authored content selection mechanism and provides any non-accessible pre-authored content (WCAG Level AA) options, then the selection mechanism can display distinctions between the accessible and non-accessible options.

      <documentation>Guideline B.4.1: Ensure the availability of features that support the production of accessible content. [Implementing B.4.1]&#xD;
Rationale: The accessible content support features will be more likely to be used, if they are turned on and are afforded reasonable prominence within the authoring tool user interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.4.1.1 Features Active by Default: All accessible content support features are turned on by default. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing B.4.1.1&#xD;
B.4.1.2 Option to Reactivate Features: The authoring tool does not include the option to turn off its accessible content support features or features which have been turned off can be turned back on. (Level A)&#xD;
Implementing B.4.1.2&#xD;
B.4.1.3 Feature Deactivation Warning: The authoring tool does not include the option to turn off its accessible content support features or, if these features can be turned off, authors are informed that this may increase the risk of content accessibility problems (WCAG). (Level AA)&#xD;

      <documentation>Guideline B.4.2: Ensure that documentation promotes the production of accessible content. [Implementing B.4.2]&#xD;
Rationale: Some authors need support in determining how to use accessible content production features (e.g. how to respond to prompts for text alternatives, how to use accessibility checking tools). Demonstrating accessible authoring as routine practice, or at least not demonstrating inaccessible practices, will help to encourage acceptance of accessibility by some authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
B.4.2.1 Model Practice (WCAG): A range of examples in the documentation (e.g. markup, screen shots of WYSIWYG editing-views) demonstrate accessible authoring practices (WCAG).

&#xD;
Proposed to BDM-ARC for endorsement (1-5 out of 10)&#xD;
1) BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
2) BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
3) BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
4) Data is at the center of BDM. BDM embraces Data Management-by-design by building services and processes that support and enable appropriate data access, standards and quality for ESDC clients, partners and staff. BDM advocates leveraging data from an authoritative source. &#xD;
5) Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
6) Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
7) Balance Service and Security. Balance proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
8) BDM will embed integrity and quality controls up-front and throughout processes and services. &#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="1. New Target Operating Model and service continuity during the transition" id="id-fa759735ab1f46768e8f2808bae8a829">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 1: &#xD;
Principle:	New Target Operating Model and service continuity during the transition &#xD;
Statement:	BDM will implement a new Target Operating Model designed for the future. Transition will be gradual and iterative ensuring service continuity.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM service modernization and service ambitions cannot be realized with technology modernization only – a new Operating Model is required. BDM will modernize services that deliver over $122B annually to Canadians, many of which are mission critical as they support most vulnerable clients in the time of need. Disruption to the delivery of these services is unacceptable.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Architectures and solutions proposed as strategic and target state will be evaluated against the new Target Operating Model.&#xD;
•	To ensure service continuity, co-existence model where new solutions and legacy operate in parallel will be required. &#xD;
•	Co-existence model inherently leads to a greater complexity than the current or target state. Among different viable architectures that are fit to support the new Target Operating Model and co-existence, less complex ones will be favoured over more complex options.&#xD;
•	Evaluation of  architectures and proposed solutions in regards to their ability to integrate and operate in a co-existence model will be presented to BDM-ARC.</documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 2: &#xD;
Principle:	BDM will consume GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will consume a GC or ESDC enterprise solution/service where it exists and meets all BDM mandatory and majority of non-mandatory functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, when there is a commitment and plan for long-term investment in sustainment and support.&#xD;
Rationale: 	With each decision to leverage an existing solution or service, BDM will inherit risks associated with the architecture, deployment, availability and operations of the solution/service. Solutions and services which may have not been designed for the scale required by BDM or lack appropriate investment commitments, product roadmaps and operational and support models, present a risk to the BDM Programme. &#xD;
Implications:	•	GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated against BDM requirements. If gaps are identified, it is expected that an investment and a project plan are put in place to close the gaps. &#xD;
•	The architecture of the GC and ESDC Enterprise Solutions/Services will be evaluated for alignment and compatibility with the BDM solution architecture. &#xD;
•	BDM may present opportunities to enhance or modernize certain enterprise solutions and services. Such opportunities will be identified as architecture options and presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 3:&#xD;
Principle:	Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions.&#xD;
Statement:	BDM will favour investment in strategic solutions and technologies over investment in interim and tactical ones. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Strategic solutions and technologies are those that are selected and deployed with a plan to support service delivery over a long term (10+ years). Tactical and interim solutions are both expected to be replaced by Strategic solutions, either in a relatively short time period (tactical) or over longer term (interim). &#xD;
Implications:	•	Investments in interim and tactical solutions, unless required for legislative, significant business value/savings or service continuity reasons, will be presented as architecture options with generally lower score for EA alignment than strategic solutions.&#xD;
•	BDM will support investments in interim and tactical solutions that are expected to deliver immediate business outcomes when they do not constitute an obstacle to the BDM implementation or significantly increase BDM technical debt. We advise to establish and monitor metrics for identified business outcomes throughout the lifecycle of the investment.&#xD;
•	Architecture of the interim or tactical solution may be reviewed if the solution needs to integrate with the BDM solution or support BDM implementation, for instance, by generating data and insights that would inform BDM service design and/or architecture.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="6. Open Solutions and standards" id="id-4ab5396b7dc14a6290bd96b387b12a64">
      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 6: &#xD;
Principle:	Open Solutions and standards. &#xD;
Statement:	Open solutions by default, proprietary by exception. SaaS and COTS that support open standards are considered open solutions. Open source will be considered where appropriate. &#xD;
Rationale: 	In an ideal scenario, solutions (or their components) are interoperable and substitutable: each one can be substituted easily and independently. This can be achieved only when solutions support open standards. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Open standards and industry best practices are and will continue to be embedded in BDM architecture and functional and non-functional requirements.&#xD;
•	Proprietary solutions that do not support open standards or are not substitutable for any reason must be identified and granted an exception by BDM-ARC and EARB. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Note on open standards and open source software (Reference: Open Standards Whitepaper on GitHub):&#xD;
The following criteria define open standards:&#xD;
process for the standard's development is open and transparent to all interested parties and cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests;&#xD;
platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;&#xD;
specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions;&#xD;
supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) is a way of developing and distributing software. The code is often written collaboratively, and it can be downloaded, used and changed by anyone.&#xD;
Open source software (OSS) and open standards are separate concepts, however there are strong ties between them. OSS tends to use and help define open standards and publicly available specifications. OSS are, by their nature, publicly available specifications, and the availability of their source code promotes open, democratic debate around their specifications, making them both more robust and interoperable. </documentation>

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 7: &#xD;
Principle:	Security and Privacy-by-Design. &#xD;
Statement:	Balance Service and Security. &#xD;
Balance Service and proactive and personalized Service Experience and Privacy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Security measure can present constraints for data collection and client interaction. Similarly, proactive and personalized service requires collecting and analyzing client data and proactively initiating interactions with the client which can be viewed as at odds with respecting client’s privacy. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will seek to balance client and business needs with appropriate security measures. &#xD;
•	Evaluation of architectures and proposed solutions in regards to applicable and supported security measures will be presented to BDM-ARC.&#xD;
•	BDM will seek to reduce constraints related to data collection and data access and sharing, while maintaining a focus on privacy (e.g. leveraging a client consent-based model). &#xD;
•	Privacy considerations are key to legislation, operational policy, service and business rules design. Through architecture and solution design, BDM will ensure that their intent in regards to privacy is maintained in implementation.</documentation>

&#xD;
Principle:	Integrity &amp; Quality-by-Design. &#xD;

Rationale: 	Embedded approach to integrity and quality management is required to move away from “pay-and-chase” model and enable continuous service improvement. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will ease burden of proof on clients, based on risk and complexity profile, while maintaining compliance and integrity checks.  &#xD;
•	Client risk, priority and complexity profile will result from integrity and quality controls embedded in processes and services.&#xD;
•	Quality and continuous improvement will be embedded in all processes.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 9: &#xD;
Principle:	Cloud First. &#xD;
Statement:	Cloud First. BDM will leverage cloud where appropriate and available.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Cloud computing means providing infrastructure services and application services on demand. This is made possible through a high level of virtualization of hardware components by way of infrastructure service software. The result is highly scalable, elastic, available and programmable infrastructure. All these characteristics are of great importance to BDM. &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will leverage cloud where applicable, available and where it meets BDM security requirements. &#xD;
•	All cloud deployment options (including SaaS) will be explored and evaluated as part of the solution design.&#xD;
•	BDM will ensure that requirements for performance, availability, and scalability (including peak traffic periods) are met by all BDM solutions and components (new and legacy) and the hosting infrastructure. &#xD;

Statement:	Data is at the center of BDM. BDM embraces Data Management-by-design by building services and processes that support and enable appropriate data access, standards and quality for ESDC clients, partners and staff. BDM advocates leveraging data from an authoritative source.  &#xD;
Rationale: 	Data has a great potential to support and inform better decisions both in service design and continuous improvement and in adjudicating and processing client applications and requests. To realize such potential, data needs to be relevant, reliable and available.  &#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will strive to enable data driven approach to decision making in service design and continuous improvement .&#xD;
•	BDM will enable data-as-a-service approach by enabling access to authoritative sources of data whenever possible. &#xD;
•	Data gathered once.&#xD;
•	Collecting the same data from the client multiple times for the use in different programs will be avoided.&#xD;
•	Transferring and replicating data will be done judiciously and only when necessary for functional or performance reasons.  &#xD;
•	Proposed data architectures, models and data flows will be presented to BDM-ARC for review.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 5: &#xD;
Principle:	Digital First. &#xD;
Statement:	Digital First. BDM will design and implement digital interfaces to enable and encourage submission of information in a digital format through the digital channel and third-party systems and end-user applications.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM target state characteristics include digitally enabled services and responsive, proactive and inclusive service experience. BDM goals, among others, include:&#xD;
•	empowering clients to self-serve by providing an attractive, seamless and end-to-end service delivery option through the digital channel;&#xD;
•	leveraging the support of NGOs, public and private sector partners to optimize and deliver a better, more impactful client outcomes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	BDM will design and implement new digital channel solutions that will enable seamless and accessible client self-service.&#xD;
•	Functionality will be exposed as services via APIs where applicable and of business value.&#xD;
•	BDM will encourage and work with service delivery partners to change their existing systems or develop new end-user applications for their staff and clients to submit data to ESDC in a digital format.&#xD;
•	Proposed external APIs will be presented to BDM-ARC for review.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 10: &#xD;
Principle:	Minimize changes to legacy. &#xD;
Statement:	Minimize changes and write-back to legacy. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Co-existence model inherently leads to significant complexity. BDM needs to design deployment strategy, transition architecture, services, processes and integration between new solutions and legacy to control complexity and risk. One of the approaches to control complexity is to minimize changes to legacy.&#xD;
Implications:	Architecture objectives and planning assumptions (to be validated through prototyping):&#xD;
•	There will be one system of record for each transaction.&#xD;
•	Transactions will be process either in the new or legacy system, not in both.&#xD;
•	Data will be accessed in the other system as needed.&#xD;
•	Certain amount of data will be migrated to the new system.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 11: &#xD;
Principle:	Architecting for Agility&#xD;
Statement:	BDM solutions will be architected for agility, creating modular and flexible architecture and reducing risks of vendor lock-in. &#xD;
Rationale: 	Architecting for agility is a fundamental shift in delivering IT services, moving away from operational inefficiencies to flexible, decoupled solutions. It will position ESDC to adapt to technology changes and ever-changing client and business needs and expectations.&#xD;
Our objective is to create a flexible and resilient BDM architecture that enables agility to continuously innovate. An architecture that has greater agility will enable ESDC to have a more fluid and flexible technology landscape, setting us up to be more responsive and adaptable to future changes.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Platforms and products that consist of individually deployable modules will be preferred over monolithic solutions.&#xD;
•	Solutions and modules will be decoupled whenever possible without causing performance or latency issues.&#xD;
•	Architecture decisions will be made just in time to enable procurement and implementation. Making them too early may create undesirable constraints on the scope and technology options.&#xD;
•	BDM will consider alternatives and keep them &quot;open&quot; as long as they remain viable. It should be recognized that not all technical decisions can be made at the same time: there is benefit to making some decisions later when they can be better informed by business decisions and through additional analysis and prototyping. &#xD;
•	BDM will be prepared to refactor (change) architecture. Architecture work products will evolve and be further developed throughout the BDM Programme lifecycle. We will iterate and improve architecture periodically and as needed.&#xD;
•	BDM will identify and analyze architectural dependencies and incorporate them into a responsive model: we will strive to integrate dependencies through loose coupling and have contingency plan when they are yet to be implemented.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This principle will compete with Principle #3: Favour strategic over interim and tactical solutions. Tactical solutions may be necessary to help us achieve desired level of agility.&#xD;
&#xD;

BDM EA WG: The principle is well received and supported by the architecture community. It communicates that architecture practice is adapting and orienting to help enable business agility.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 12: &#xD;
Principle:	Maximize Use of Core Technology&#xD;
Statement:	Consider leveraging capabilities and functionality of the Core Technology (Cùram Social Program Management) before considering other solutions and applications for common benefit processing and service delivery.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Leveraging investment in the platform and making use of OOTB business logic and processes will greatly improve ESDC agility and ability to implement new benefits and implement changes to existing benefits and processes.&#xD;
Additionally, this will reduce complexity of implementation and cost of ownership minimizing the need for integration with other dependant applications. &#xD;
Implications:	•	Business may have to accept that not all requirements will be fully met by the Core Technology solution. &#xD;
•	Design of some future state business processes may need to be adjusted to leverage OOTB business logic and processes.&#xD;
•	Evolving business needs may require moving away from specific capabilities of the Core Technology solution in the future. This situation would trigger changes in architecture, transition to either specialized best of breed or enterprise solutions and possibly procurement. Principle #11: Architecting for Agility mitigates this implication.&#xD;
•	Core Technology solution architecture becomes the architecture for the Common Benefit Delivery Platform.  &#xD;
•	Enables alignment of the BDM solution evolution and improvements with the Cùram Social Program Management product roadmap and plans for future improvements.&#xD;
•	Supports an MVP approach.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Increased risk of vendor lock-in.&#xD;

      <documentation>BDM Architecture Principle 13: &#xD;
Principle:	Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture&#xD;
Statement:	Preference will be given to event-driven architecture to help build decoupled, responsive, adaptive and resilient solutions.&#xD;
Rationale: 	Modernization of digital channels and services, as well as planned advances in service delivery and common benefit processing, require ability to access data and process events and transactions in (near) real time. Solutions and services need to be designed to “react to events” and process them in (near) real time where desirable and to the extent possible.&#xD;
This type of architecture adds a layer that further decouples architecture components, making the overall architecture more adaptive and resilient.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Key objective is to move from batch to predominantly (near) real-time services and transactions.&#xD;
•	Every integration should be considered for event driven approach. BDM will implement the most appropriate pattern for each integration with a view to move to event-driven integrations whenever this approach is aligned with the business processes the integration enables. &#xD;
•	We will assess supporting solutions and dependencies for their ability of being event driven and can participate without added complexity.&#xD;
•	Best practices and lessons learned from previous successful implementations of these technologies will be consulted prior to making the decision.&#xD;
•	We do not recommend “Everything is an Event” approach. Complementary integration patterns exist and will be considered for integrations that are not natively event-driven. Data integration technologies are available too!&#xD;
•	Selection and implementation of an Event Broker and Messaging Platform becomes high priority for Tranche 1.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Cùram SPM includes OOTB batch processes that need to be implemented as defined by the platform. No previous implementations of Cùram were based on event driven architecture.&#xD;
•	Caveat: This type of architecture requires highly-available and resilient network and infrastructure. Cost may increase.&#xD;
•	Caveat: Will require high transaction rate through SCED which raises performance and bandwidth concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
BDM EA WG: The principle is well received and supported by the architecture community. Despite caveats, this is a good principle to have to communicate desire to move from batch to predominantly real-time client services and transaction processing.&#xD;

Principle:	Outcome-driven (proposed by business architecture)&#xD;
Statement:	Architectural decisions will seek to maximize value to clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC driven by the overall Programme strategy.&#xD;
Rationale: 	BDM will seek to realize benefits for clients, partners, staff, ESDC, and the GoC.  Decisions regarding the architecture of BDM should be primarily focused on delivering on the outcomes outlined in the strategy.&#xD;
Implications:	•	Decisions regarding the technical and solution architecture should be weighed against their ability to achieve strategic outcomes and impact on the targeted stakeholders&#xD;
•	Capabilities delivered as part of the BDM programme, enabled by the technology, will be linked to the outcomes that they support, value they deliver, and benefits realized &#xD;

      <documentation>Government data shall be considered open if it is made public in a way that complies with the principles below:&#xD;
&#xD;
Complete&#xD;
All public data is made available. Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
While non-electronic information resources, such as physical artifacts, are not subject to the Open Government Data principles, it is always encouraged that such resources be made available electronically to the extent feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Bulk data” means that an entire dataset can be acquired. Even the simplest of applications, such as computing the sum of line items, requires access to the entire dataset. This principle also implies that bulk data should be made available before “APIs” are created because APIs typically only return small slices of the whole data.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
Sunlight Foundation Open Data Policy Guidelines (2012) (“Publish Bulk Data”)&#xD;
Primary&#xD;
Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
If an entity chooses to transform data by aggregation or transcoding for use on an Internet site built for end users, it still has an obligation to make the full-resolution information available in bulk for others to build their own sites with and to preserve the data for posterity.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013) (“Complete”)&#xD;
Timely&#xD;
Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013)&#xD;
Accessible&#xD;
Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data must be made available on the Internet so as to accommodate the widest practical range of users and uses. This means considering how choices in data preparation and publication affect access to the disabled and how it may impact users of a variety of software and hardware platforms. Data must be published with current industry standard protocols and formats, as well as alternative protocols and formats when industry standards impose burdens on wide reuse of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data is not accessible if it can be retrieved only through navigating web forms, or if automated tools are not permitted to access it because of a robots.txt file, other policy, or technological restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
Open Definition (2005) (“Access”, “Absense of Technological Restriction”)&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013) (“Accessible”)&#xD;
Machine processable&#xD;
Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ability for data to be widely used requires that the data be properly encoded. Free-form text is not a substitute for tabular and normalized records. Images of text are not a substitute for the text itself. Sufficient documentation on the data format and meanings of normalized data items must be available to users of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Association of Computing Machinery’s Recommendation on Open Government (February 2009) stated this principle another way: “Data published by the government should be in formats and approaches that promote analysis and reuse of that data.” The most critical value of open government data comes from the public’s ability to carry out its own analyses of raw data, rather than relying on a government’s own analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As part of this, the use of unique, numeric identifiers for entities mentioned in the data can help connect the data to other relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
ACM Recommendation on Open Government (2009)&#xD;
Sunlight Foundation Open Data Policy Guidelines (2012) (“Mandate The Use Of Unique Identifiers”)&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013) (“Accessible”)&#xD;
Non-discriminatory&#xD;
Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
Anonymous access to the data must be allowed for public data, including access through anonymous proxies. Data should not be hidden behind “walled gardens.”&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;

Sunlight Foundation Open Data Policy Guidelines (2012) (“Remove Restrictions For Accessing Information”)&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013) (“Accessible”)&#xD;
Non-proprietary&#xD;
Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
Proprietary formats add unnecessary restrictions over who can use the data, how it can be used and shared, and whether the data will be usable in the future. While some proprietary formats are nearly ubiquitous, it is nevertheless not acceptable to use only proprietary formats. Likewise, the relevant non-proprietary formats may not reach a wide audience. In these cases, it may be necessary to make the data available in multiple formats.&#xD;
&#xD;
This principle also appears in...&#xD;
Sunlight Foundation Open Data Policy Guidelines (2012) (“Mandate Open Formats”)&#xD;
White House M-13-13 (2013) (“Accessible”)&#xD;
License-free&#xD;
Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Because government information is a mix of public records, personal information, copyrighted work, and other non-open data, it is important to be clear about what data is available and what licensing, terms of service, and legal restrictions apply. Data for which no restrictions apply should be marked clearly as being in the public domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Requiring attribution to the government, even though attribution might be reasonable in other contexts, would constitute a major policy shift in the United States with significant legal implications for the press. The Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication can make a work license-free.&#xD;

Definitions&#xD;
“public” means:&#xD;
The Open Government Data principles do not address what data should be public and open. Privacy, security, and other concerns may legally (and rightly) prevent data sets from being shared with the public. Rather, these principles specify the conditions public data should meet to be considered “open.”&#xD;
&#xD;
“data” means:&#xD;
Electronically stored information or recordings. Examples include documents, databases of contracts, transcripts of hearings, and audio/visual recordings of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
While non-electronic information resources, such as physical artifacts, are not subject to the Open Government Data principles, it is always encouraged that such resources be made available electronically to the extent feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
“reviewable” means:&#xD;
A contact person must be designated to respond to people trying to use the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
A contact person must be designated to respond to complaints about violations of the principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
An administrative or judicial court must have the jurisdiction to review whether the agency has applied these principles appropriately.&#xD;

      <documentation>5. Machine Processable&#xD;
Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ability for data to be widely used requires that the data be properly encoded. Free-form text is not a substitute for tabular and normalized records. Images of text are not a substitute for the text itself. Sufficient documentation on the data format and meanings of normalized data items must be available to users of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Association of Computing Machinery’s Recommendation on Open Government (February 2009) (http://www.acm.org/public-policy/open-government) stated this principle another way: “Data published by the government should be in formats and approaches that promote analysis and reuse of that data.” The most critical value of open government data comes from the public’s ability to carry out its own analyses of raw data, rather than relying on a government’s own analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As part of this, the use of unique, numeric identifiers for entities mentioned in the data can help connect the data to other relevant information.&#xD;

      <documentation>7. Non-Proprietary&#xD;
Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
Proprietary formats add unnecessary restrictions over who can use the data, how it can be used and shared, and whether the data will be usable in the future. While some proprietary formats are nearly ubiquitous, it is nevertheless not acceptable to use only proprietary formats. Likewise, the relevant non-proprietary formats may not reach a wide audience. In these cases, it may be necessary to make the data available in multiple formats.&#xD;

“public” means:&#xD;
The Open Government Data principles do not address what data should be public and open. Privacy, security, and other concerns may legally (and rightly) prevent data sets from being shared with the public. Rather, these principles specify the conditions public data should meet to be considered “open.”&#xD;
&#xD;
“data” means:&#xD;
Electronically stored information or recordings. Examples include documents, databases of contracts, transcripts of hearings, and audio/visual recordings of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
While non-electronic information resources, such as physical artifacts, are not subject to the Open Government Data principles, it is always encouraged that such resources be made available electronically to the extent feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
“reviewable” means:&#xD;
A contact person must be designated to respond to people trying to use the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
A contact person must be designated to respond to complaints about violations of the principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
An administrative or judicial court must have the jurisdiction to review whether the agency has applied these principles appropriately.</documentation>

&#xD;
Collective Benefit states that data ecosystems should be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. Institutions must actively support and facilitate the use of data by Indigenous communities. This would promote the decision-making power of Indigenous nations by providing them with a better understanding of their peoples, territories, and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
Authority to control refers to empowering Indigenous Peoples and communities to determine how Indigenous cultures, land, resources, knowledge, and people are represented and identified within data. Indigenous Peoples have the right to access data relevant to their world views, to develop cultural governance protocols for Indigenous data, and to be active leaders in the stewardship of and access to Indigenous data and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how the use of the data supports Indigenous self-determination and collective benefit. This responsibility includes providing access to resources to generate Indigenous data, supporting the development of an Indigenous data workforce, and ensuring that the creation, interpretation, and use of data is respectful to Indigenous communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ethics refers to the maintaining of ethical data processes that prioritize the well-being and rights of Indigenous Peoples across all stages of the data life cycle. Ethical data should strive to minimize current and potential future harm. Data should not stigmatize or portray Indigenous Peoples, cultures, or knowledge in terms of deficits.</documentation>

      <documentation>What are the FAIR principles?&#xD;
The FAIR principles, developed by a coalition of researchers, data stewards, and institutions in the academic and public sectors in 2016, are a set of best practices designed to make data valuable and usable over time. They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
Findable: Data should be easy to find by both humans and machines.&#xD;
Accessible: Data should be available in a usable format with clear access protocols and constraints.&#xD;
Interoperable: Data must be compatible across different systems and formats.&#xD;
Reusable: Data should be structured and documented in such a way that others can easily and appropriately reuse it for further analysis or innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
In 2020, the Government of Canada released the Roadmap for Open Science, urging all federal departments and agencies to develop strategies and tools for implementing the FAIR data principles. The goal was to improve the interoperability of research data across the public sector. Building on this momentum, Health Canada, along with other federal bodies, integrated these principles into Health Canada's Open Science Action Plan, which officially launched in 2022. And in 2025, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat published the Guidance on Assessing Readiness to Manage Data According to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Principles which provides recommendations on how to apply the FAIR principles in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, the FAIR principles, while promoting open data, do not fully address issues related to power imbalances and historical context. To complement FAIR, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance introduced the CARE principles—collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics. These principles ensure that data practices support Indigenous innovation and self-determination, emphasizing ethical stewardship and the importance of Indigenous Peoples' rights. By integrating CARE alongside FAIR, the aim is to empower Indigenous communities and respect their sovereignty in data governance.</documentation>

Organizing data to be easily found, accessed, and reused not only saves time but also helps you make smarter, more informed decisions that drive better outcomes. With seamless data sharing, collaboration becomes easier, and the public can trust that their government is working in their best interest. By storing data in sustainable formats, you future-proof it for long-term use, ensuring it remains valuable for future decision-makers. This easy access to data sparks innovation and creative solutions, driving progress in the public sector. Ultimately, the FAIR principles foster transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship, building public trust in government.</documentation>

&#xD;
Statement&#xD;
BDM supports the preparation and maintenance of in ways that enable its reuse across multiple programs, services, and contexts. Reusability focuses on making data accessible, understandable, and fit for purpose—regardless of how it was originally acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rationale&#xD;
1.	Promotes efficiency by reducing duplication of effort across programs and initiatives&#xD;
2.	Supports consistency and standardization in how data is interpreted and applied&#xD;
3.	Enables scalable and agile program delivery by leveraging existing data assets&#xD;
4.	Reduces time and cost for future initiatives by building on trusted, well-documented data&#xD;
5.	Encourages a shift from one-off data use to sustainable, service-oriented data practices&#xD;
6.	Aligns with Government of Canada goals for data stewardship, openness, and innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
Implications&#xD;
1.	BDM will develop and maintain reusable data products and services, with clear ownership and documentation&#xD;
2.	Metadata, definitions, and contextual information will be provided to support discoverability and usability&#xD;
3.	Data will be cleaned, standardized, and versioned to ensure it can be reliably reused across different use cases&#xD;
4.	Governance processes will support the validation, certification, and lifecycle management of reusable data assets&#xD;
5.	Program teams will be encouraged to design data outputs with reuse in mind, even if the data was not originally collected by them&#xD;
6.	Reusability will be treated as a strategic capability, enabling innovation and cross-program collaboration&#xD;
7.	This principle focuses on how data is prepared and maintained, complementing the “Collected once, Use Multiple” principle, which focuses on data capture once and reuse multiple times.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.2.3.	Lessons learned in response to the Covid-19 response&#xD;
The experience of reporting on the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) has highlighted weaknesses in our data foundations.  Data gaps and a lack of clear and effective processes and procedures for data sharing and management delayed or prevented analysis of the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on marginalized and racialized groups.  Reporting of summary data by province, age and gender was not achievable within timeframes required for rapid analysis and response.  Data from different parts of the department were in conflict, and executives did not have confidence in the quality of the data.  This proposal builds on the rapidly deployed assets CDO has created to address these urgent problems, and will help the department be prepared to quickly and accurately provide consistent and reliable answers to business questions by ensuring that data is ready, detailed and reliable to support reporting and analysis needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 1 – Accountability&#xD;
The principle of accountability in PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) outlines organizations’ responsibility in protecting the personal information they collect, use, and disclose. The accountability principle is the first of the ten principles set forth in PIPEDA and establishes the foundation for the other principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Accountability: Organizations are responsible for the personal information under their control and must designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for ensuring compliance with the principles.&#xD;
The accountability principle under PIPEDA requires businesses to designate at least one individual whose responsibility is to ensure compliance with this data privacy law.&#xD;
&#xD;
The designated individual responsible for PIPEDA compliance should create a simple and easily understandable privacy notice that outlines the ten crucial principles. They may also be responsible for responding to access requests, assisting in conducting data security audits, and other related tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important to ensure that your PIPEDA compliance appointee is qualified and adequately supported to fulfill their duties.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Principle 2 – Identifying Purposes" id="id-09c228a5de164865aea5b3f13ab8da39">
      <documentation>Principle 2 – Identifying Purposes&#xD;
The principle of identifying purposes is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the importance of organizations being transparent and upfront about the reasons for collecting personal information. The goal is to ensure that individuals know and understand why their information is being collected, used, or disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Identifying purposes: Organizations must identify the purposes for collecting personal information at or before the time the information is collected.&#xD;
Regarding this principle, Canada's PIPEDA requires you to clearly define and communicate the reasons why you are collecting a specific type of data. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that you:&#xD;
1. Inform individuals about why their information is being collected.&#xD;
2. Take necessary measures to avoid using the collected data for purposes other than those specified.&#xD;
3. Notify consumers if the collected information will be used for a new purpose, allowing you to seek fresh consent to use the data for that purpose.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Principle 4 – Limiting Collection" id="id-47e565269efc4acca0e68020f7f9d62a">
      <documentation>Principle 4 – Limiting Collection&#xD;
The principle of limiting collection is a fundamental aspect of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle outlines the requirement for organizations to limit the collection of personal information to what is necessary for the purposes identified. The goal is to ensure that organizations do not indiscriminately gather more personal information than is needed for their stated objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Limiting data collection: Organizations must limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes identified and must collect information by fair and lawful means.&#xD;
It is essential to review your processes for the collection of personal information to differentiate between information that is absolutely necessary to collect and information that you do not need to collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
This distinction is important because the fourth principle of Canada's PIPEDA requires your business to only collect information that is strictly necessary and consistent with the purposes for which your users have given consent. This includes being mindful of collecting sensitive personal health information and ensuring that its collection is justified and appropriate for the intended purposes.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention" id="id-e057c3ae38ba40deb7ba48bcc1df1217">
      <documentation>Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention&#xD;
The PIPEDA principle of limiting use, disclosure, and retention is part of the broader framework that governs the protection of personal information under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. This principle establishes guidelines for organizations regarding the appropriate use, disclosure, and retention of personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Limiting use, disclosure, and retention: Organizations must use or disclose personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected, unless the individual has consented to another use or disclosure, or when required by law. They must retain personal information only as long as necessary for the identified purposes.&#xD;
To achieve compliance with Canada PIPEDA, you need to create policies and guidelines, which guarantee that you utilize consumer information for reasons that are in line with what your users consented to.&#xD;
&#xD;
Similarly, you need to institute policies concerning the duration you intend to retain this data. Ideally, the duration should not exceed the time necessary period to execute the stated purposes of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conversely, if you employ this data to draw conclusions about a user, you are required to retain this information for a period considered enough to allow the user in question to review this information.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Principle 3 – Consent" id="id-568d110d10e546cebc061e56e133edb7">
      <documentation>Principle 3 – Consent&#xD;
The principle of consent is a fundamental aspect of Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). This principle governs organizations’ collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, emphasizing the importance of obtaining the individual’s consent as a key element of respecting privacy rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Consent: Individuals must be informed of the purposes for which their personal information is being collected, and consent must be obtained before or at the time of collection.&#xD;
If you are a data controller subject to Canada's PIPEDA, you are obligated to seek implied or explicit consent, depending on the circumstances. The consent has to be meaningful. In some cases, implied consent is considered meaningful, while in other cases, only express consent is considered meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important to ensure that your data subjects are fully aware of what giving consent means and that they do not feel coerced or deceived into giving consent. This includes informing them about any potential risks or significant harm that may arise from the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, you need to keep records of instances where you do not deem user consent necessary, especially when there may be a risk of significant harm or when dealing with sensitive personal health information.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 6 – Accuracy&#xD;
The principle of accuracy is one of the fundamental principles outlined in PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the importance of ensuring that personal information collected by organizations is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
6. Accuracy: Organizations must keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.&#xD;
According to this principle, you are expected to ensure that all the personal information you collect is precise, complete, and updated as required for the stated purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
Compliance with Canada PIPEDA requirements in line with this principle is dependent on how you utilize the information you collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ideally, you need to ensure the information you use to make inferences about users is updated to minimize the risk of making decisions about individuals using inaccurate data.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 7 – Safeguards&#xD;
The principle of safeguards is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the responsibility of organizations to implement measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and alteration. The goal is to ensure the security and confidentiality of individuals’ personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
7. Safeguards: Organizations must protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification through appropriate security measures.&#xD;
Considered one of the most crucial principles under Canada's PIPEDA, you need to ensure that the information you collect is safeguarded against unauthorized access, theft, copying, or modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important to note that the security of user information is essential even when you are disposing of records.&#xD;
&#xD;
The level of protection should be proportionate to the sensitivity of the information you collect. Your data protection measures can include physical access barriers, such as passwords, organizational measures, such as granting access to specific staff members, or technological approaches, such as encryption.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 8 – Openness&#xD;
The principle of openness, also known as the principle of transparency, is a fundamental component of Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). This principle emphasizes the importance of organizations being open and transparent about their privacy policies, practices, and procedures related to collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
8. Openness: Organizations must be open about their policies and practices regarding the management of personal information and must make this information readily available to individuals.&#xD;
This principle requires you to ensure that you inform users about how you gather, process, and store their data. You should provide information about your personal data policies and processes in your privacy policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, you need to include the name and contact information of the individual you have appointed to facilitate compliance with PIPEDA.&#xD;

      <documentation>Principle 9 – Individual Access&#xD;
The principle of individual access is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle grants individuals the right to access their personal information held by organizations and allows them to challenge the accuracy and completeness of that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
9. Individual access: Upon request, individuals must be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of their personal information and must be given access to that information. They must also be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.&#xD;
If an individual submits a written request regarding their personal data, you must respond by providing information about whether you have collected data about them, the type of data collected, how it has been used, and the third parties who have had access to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, this PIPEDA principle requires you to allow individuals to determine whether the data you hold about them is inaccurate or incomplete. If they identify inaccuracies or incompleteness, you must allow them to correct or update the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Essentially, you are required to provide a complete response within 30 days of receiving the initial request.</documentation>

      <documentation>Principle 10 – Challenging Compliance&#xD;
The PIPEDA principle of challenging compliance addresses the right of individuals to challenge an organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle is sometimes called the “Challenging Compliance” or “Individual Recourse” principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
10. Challenging compliance: Individuals must be able to challenge an organization's compliance with the principles of PIPEDA, and the organization must have procedures in place to address such challenges.&#xD;
The tenth principle of Canada's PIPEDA requires you to establish procedures for receiving, reviewing, and addressing complaints of non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Typically, you are expected to investigate the complaint and take necessary actions if you find the complaint to be valid. This may involve modifying your policies or processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Next, you need to inform the complainant about the actions taken and provide information on the steps they can take if they are not satisfied with your response to the complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important to provide information to consumers on how they can challenge compliance with the privacy policy.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="What PIPEDA is in Canada? (Meaning)" id="id-d5a586d18a1c41588d000ff9f37a641b">
      <documentation>What is the PIPEDA in Canada?&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA is a Canadian law relating to data privacy. PIPEDA governs how private sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information during commercial business activities. It became effective in April 2000 and seeks to balance an individual’s right to privacy with the need of organizations to collect and use personal information for legitimate business purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA stands for the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. A federal privacy law in Canada governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by private sector organizations. PIPEDA came into effect on January 1, 2004, and it applies to organizations that engage in commercial activities and operate across provincial or national borders.&#xD;
&#xD;
The key principles of PIPEDA include:&#xD;
&#xD;
Consent: Organizations must obtain the individual’s consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information, except in certain specific circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accountability: Organizations are responsible for the personal information under their control and must designate individuals accountable for the organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose Limitation: Personal information must be collected for specified purposes and should not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the individual’s consent or as required by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accuracy: Organizations must make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
Safeguards: Organizations must implement security safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
Openness: Organizations must be open about their privacy policies and practices, making information about these readily available to individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
Individual Access: Individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to challenge its accuracy if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
Challenging Compliance: Individuals have the right to challenge an organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA. Organizations must have procedures in place to respond to such challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA applies to the private sector, but some provinces have enacted similar legislation that applies to the public sector within those provinces. Organizations need to understand and comply with PIPEDA to protect individuals’ privacy rights in collecting and using their personal information.&#xD;

What is PIPEDA?&#xD;
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) is a federal privacy act that regulates how private-sector organizations handle personal information during commercial activities. The goal of PIPEDA is to balance the privacy rights of individuals with the legitimate needs of organizations to collect, use, and disclose personal information for reasonable purposes. PIPEDA applies to all private-sector organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information during commercial activities, with the exception of those in Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia, which have their own private sector privacy laws that are substantially similar to PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fair information principles of PIPEDA are the foundation for the law's approach to privacy protection. These principles are based on ten internationally recognized principles for the protection of personal data, including accountability, transparency, and consent. PIPEDA requires organizations to be accountable for the personal information they collect, use, and disclose and to take appropriate measures to safeguard this information. It also requires organizations to be transparent about their privacy policies and practices and to obtain the consent of individuals before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Overall, PIPEDA provides a comprehensive framework for protecting personal information in the course of commercial activities. By following the fair information principles and guidelines for PIPEDA compliance, organizations can ensure that they are protecting the privacy rights of Canadians while still being able to carry out their legitimate business activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) is a federal law in Canada that governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by organizations in the course of commercial activities. The law applies to organizations in all sectors, including private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and federal government organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.</documentation>

      <documentation>How Does PIPEDA Compare to Other Data Protection Laws Worldwide?&#xD;
PIPEDA, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, is similar in many ways to data protection laws worldwide, especially those based on common principles like consent, accountability, and transparency.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, some key differences and nuances exist when comparing PIPEDA to other data protection laws worldwide, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States’ various state-specific privacy laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
Compared to the United States, where there is no comprehensive federal privacy law, individual states have started enacting their privacy legislation, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and subsequent laws in other states.&#xD;
&#xD;
===================&#xD;

How does PIPEDA compare to other data protection laws worldwide?&#xD;
PIPEDA is a comprehensive law on the protection of personal information. When compared to other data privacy laws worldwide, it shares both similarities and differences with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the global landscape, there are two general trends in data protection: one set by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the other set by the few US state laws we have so far, most notably the California CCPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
In terms of individual consent requirements, PIPEDA leans more toward the GDPR. It doesn't mandate explicit consent in every single case, but the majority of online interactions with users would still require some form of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
This sets it apart from the opt-out framework present in the CCPA, but they do share a similarity in terms of applicability. PIPEDA applies only to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information in the course of commercial activities. This means that if the data has not been collected as part of a commercial activity, it does not fall under the scope of PIPEDA.</documentation>

      <documentation>Who does PIPEDA apply to?&#xD;
PIPEDA applies to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
All private-sector organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information during commercial activities, including businesses, non-profit organizations, and charities, with the exception of those in Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia.&#xD;
Federally regulated organizations, such as banks, airlines, and telecommunications companies, regardless of where they are located in Canada.&#xD;
Inter-provincial providers of goods and services, such as online retailers, and transportation companies that operate in more than one province.&#xD;
Government organizations, such as federal government agencies, but only with respect to their commercial activities.&#xD;
It is worth noting that PIPEDA does not apply to government organizations when they are carrying out their public functions, such as law enforcement or national security. In summary, PIPEDA applies to a wide range of organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information during commercial activities, with the exception of those in Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia that have their own private sector privacy laws. By following the guidelines for PIPEDA compliance, organizations can ensure that they are protecting the privacy rights of Canadians while still being able to carry out their business activities.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="Do I need to comply with the PIPEDA principles? (Meaning)" id="id-bd37f55e1a594601b7b8c4b08030f1a6">
      <documentation>Do I need to comply with the PIPEDA principles?&#xD;
Determining whether your business needs to comply with the PIPEDA principles depends on several factors, and it's crucial to seek legal advice for a definitive answer, especially considering the potential updates anticipated in 2024. However, here's a general overview based on current regulations:&#xD;
&#xD;
You likely need to comply with PIPEDA if:&#xD;
&#xD;
You operate a private-sector organization within Canada.&#xD;
Your business collects, uses, or discloses personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) in the course of commercial activities.&#xD;
You likely don't need to comply with PIPEDA if:&#xD;
&#xD;
Your organization is non-profit or primarily engages in non-commercial activities.&#xD;
Your business is based outside of Canada.&#xD;
You don't collect, use, or disclose personal information.&#xD;
However, even if PIPEDA doesn't directly apply to your business, it's recommended to follow its principles as best practices to demonstrate responsible data handling and build trust with customers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nevertheless, based on general case law, it can be inferred that Canada's data protection law extends to foreign organizations that possess a genuine and significant connection to the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
According to Section 4 of PIPEDA, it applies to personal information that:&#xD;
&#xD;
Any organization collects, uses, or discloses for commercial purposes, or&#xD;
Identifies an employee or job applicant.&#xD;
It explicitly does not apply to:&#xD;
&#xD;
Government institutions&#xD;
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for personal or domestic purposes, and&#xD;
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.&#xD;
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) has determined that PIPEDA applies to foreign businesses when they handle the personal information of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, in the 411Numbers case, the OPC concluded that PIPEDA is applicable to a business that has a genuine and significant connection to Canada. This connection could be based on factors such as whether the business processes the personal data of Canadians, whether its privacy practices could affect Canadians, whether they promote its products and services in Canada, and similar considerations.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="Scope of PIPEDA (Meaning)" id="id-31e700a8d0c245279c861e35e949068e">
      <documentation>Scope of PIPEDA&#xD;
Under PIPEDA, all organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities are required to comply with the law. This includes private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and federal government organizations that engage in commercial activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA applies to personal information, which is broadly defined as any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, social insurance number, financial information, and medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, PIPEDA does not apply to all personal information or all organizations. There are several exemptions to PIPEDA, including for organizations that operate solely within a province or territory with its own substantially similar privacy legislation, organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes, and employee personal information used for employment purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important for organizations to determine whether they are subject to PIPEDA and, if so, to ensure they comply with the requirements of the law. Failure to comply with PIPEDA can result in penalties, damage to an organization's reputation, and loss of consumer trust.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="What is personal information under PIPEDA? (Meaning)" id="id-be0133f8e2984051b7250b5448ef3e2f">
      <documentation>What is personal information under PIPEDA?&#xD;
Personal information is defined broadly under PIPEDA as any information about an identifiable individual, such as their name, address, email, phone number, date of birth, social insurance number, driver's license, or blood type. PIPEDA also includes sensitive data, such as an individual's ethnic origin, social status, and personal health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Under PIPEDA, organizations are required to obtain an individual's consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information, except in certain circumstances, such as when the information is required by law or in an emergency. Organizations must also limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information to what is necessary for their stated purposes and must ensure that the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, PIPEDA requires organizations to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, or retention. This includes physical, organizational, and technological security measures, such as secure storage facilities, access controls, and encryption.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to request that any inaccuracies be corrected. They also have the right to file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) if they believe that their privacy rights have been violated. In cases of a data breach, organizations are required to notify affected individuals and the OPC, and may face disciplinary actions if they are found to be non-compliant with PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
In comparison to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), PIPEDA provides similar protections for personal information, but is generally considered to be less strict in its requirements. However, as data privacy continues to be a significant privacy issue for Canadians, the OPC continues to monitor PIPEDA compliance and make recommendations for improvements to privacy legislation.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="Provincial laws and compliance with PIPEDA (Meaning)" id="id-ae677c8eb24a48a6ac18cd9d26df4741">
      <documentation>Provincial laws and compliance with PIPEDA&#xD;
While PIPEDA is a federal privacy act that applies across Canada, some provinces have their own privacy laws that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by organizations within their jurisdiction. These laws may be similar to PIPEDA or may have different requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta are examples of provinces that have their own private-sector privacy laws. Organizations that operate solely within these provinces may be subject to the provincial laws instead of PIPEDA. However, if an organization operates in multiple provinces or territories, it may still need to comply with PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
In Ontario, while PIPEDA applies to most private-sector organizations, the province also has its own privacy legislation, the Personal Health Information Protection Act, which applies to personal health information collected, used, or disclosed by health information custodians in the province&#xD;
&#xD;
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador do not have private-sector privacy laws, but have adopted substantially similar legislation regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. Organizations in these provinces must still comply with PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) is responsible for overseeing compliance with PIPEDA and ensuring that individuals' privacy rights are protected. The OPC investigates complaints about privacy issues and has the power to take enforcement action against organizations that violate PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Under PIPEDA, individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to request that it be corrected if it is inaccurate. Organizations must also limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information to only what is necessary for the purposes identified, and must protect personal information with appropriate security measures. Organizations must obtain meaningful consent of the individual before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information, and must retain personal information only as long as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
Federally-regulated organizations, such as banks, telecommunications providers, and airlines, are subject to PIPEDA and may also be subject to additional regulations. The GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a privacy law that applies to organizations in the European Union, as well as to some organizations outside the EU that collect or process the personal data of individuals in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure an organization's compliance with PIPEDA, it may appoint a privacy officer to oversee the organization's privacy practices and ensure that they are in line with PIPEDA and other applicable privacy laws. Organizations should also regularly review their privacy policies and practices to ensure that they are up-to-date and in compliance with the law. By doing so, organizations can protect the privacy and personal data of individuals and avoid penalties for non-compliance.</documentation>

Requirements under PIPEDA&#xD;
Under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, organizations must comply with various requirements when collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. These requirements include:&#xD;
&#xD;
Obtaining Consent: Before an organization collects, uses, or discloses an individual's personal information, they must obtain meaningful consent from the individual. The individual must also be informed of the purpose for which their information is being collected, used, or disclosed.&#xD;
Limiting Use, Collection, and Disclosure: Organizations must limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information to only that which is necessary for the identified purposes. Any new purposes for which the information will be used must also require consent.&#xD;
Ensuring Accuracy: Organizations must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
Retention: Organizations must only retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes.&#xD;
Safeguarding Personal Information: Organizations must implement appropriate security safeguards, such as physical, organizational, and technological measures, to protect personal information from unauthorized access.&#xD;
Providing Access: Upon request, organizations must inform individuals about the existence, use, and disclosure of their personal information and provide them with access to that information.&#xD;
Allowing Individuals to Challenge: Individuals have the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of their personal information and request that it be amended if necessary.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the Information: Organizations must recognize the sensitivity of certain types of information, such as personal health information, and provide additional protection as required.&#xD;
Responding to Inquiries and Complaints: Organizations must respond to inquiries and complaints about their privacy practices in a timely and appropriate manner.&#xD;
Failure to comply with these requirements can result in penalties, damage to an organization's reputation, and loss of consumer trust. In severe cases, individuals may take legal action against organizations, and federal courts can order remedies for significant harm caused by unauthorized access to personal information.</documentation>

      <documentation>Exceptions to PIPEDA requirements&#xD;
While PIPEDA outlines many requirements that organizations must follow to protect individuals' personal information, there are some exceptions to these requirements. In certain circumstances, personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the individual's consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.&#xD;
Personal information collected, used, or disclosed for purposes related to national security, defense, or public safety.&#xD;
Personal information collected from an individual as part of their employment application or employment relationship.&#xD;
Medical information and financial information may be subject to additional regulations or exemptions under other legislation.&#xD;
It is important for organizations to note that these exceptions are not absolute, and they must still ensure that they are taking appropriate measures to safeguard the personal information and only collecting, using, or disclosing personal information to the extent necessary to achieve the specified purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
Organizations should also be aware that certain types of personal information may be subject to special considerations and exemptions under PIPEDA. For example, the collection, use, or disclosure of sensitive personal information, such as medical or financial information, may be subject to additional requirements and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, organizations must ensure that they are complying with any applicable provincial laws related to personal information protection. Provinces such as Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta have their own private-sector privacy laws, which may have different requirements and exemptions than PIPEDA.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Constraint" name="Enforcement and Penalties (Constraint)" id="id-36c4791b151c4f51bde2638b7a9f9247">
      <documentation>Enforcement and penalties&#xD;
The Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) is responsible for enforcing PIPEDA and ensuring that organizations comply with its requirements. The Commissioner has the power to investigate complaints made by individuals or conduct investigations on its own initiative. In addition, the Commissioner can make recommendations to organizations and issue orders to ensure compliance with PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Failure to comply with PIPEDA can result in significant penalties for organizations. For example, organizations that violate PIPEDA can be subject to fines of up to $100,000 CAD for each violation. In addition, individuals affected by a violation of PIPEDA may also be entitled to damages for any harm suffered as a result of the violation.&#xD;
&#xD;
There have been numerous examples of organizations penalized for non-compliance with PIPEDA. In one high-profile case, a major Canadian telecommunications company was fined $100,000 CAD after the Privacy Commissioner found that it had failed to adequately protect the personal information of its customers.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is important for organizations to take PIPEDA compliance seriously in order to avoid penalties and maintain the trust of their customers. Organizations should establish clear policies and procedures for protecting personal information, ensure that employees are trained on PIPEDA requirements, and regularly review and update their privacy practices to ensure compliance with any changes to the law.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Meaning" name="Are there any other data privacy laws in Canada? (Meaning)" id="id-650c8b6f7c6449e79e6053aee89dd787">
      <documentation>Are there any other data privacy laws in Canada?&#xD;
Beyond PIPEDA, various data privacy laws and regulations shape the Canadian legal landscape. Here's a breakdown of the key ones:&#xD;
&#xD;
Provincial Data Privacy Laws:&#xD;
&#xD;
Alberta: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) (enacted in 2004)&#xD;
British Columbia: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) (enacted in 2000)&#xD;
Quebec: Privacy Legislation Modernization Act (Law 25) (enacted in 2022)&#xD;
These provincial laws are largely similar to PIPEDA in their core principles but can have key differences in areas like consent requirements and enforcement mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
These provincial laws are similar to PIPEDA but may have stricter requirements. For example, Quebec's law might require more specific and informed consent compared to PIPEDA. Each province also has its own enforcement mechanisms for its privacy law.&#xD;
&#xD;
Other Relevant Legislation:&#xD;
&#xD;
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) (enacted in 1983): This federal law governs how public bodies handle personal information.&#xD;

      <documentation>10. Ethical considerations of utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in data visualization&#xD;
While the integration of AI to enhance data visualizations can provide quicker insights, it is important to ensure that risks are appropriately considered and mitigated. This section provides key considerations to enable the responsible use of AI in data visualizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Note that AI can be embedded within data visualizations. From automated insights to natural language querying, AI capabilities span a broad spectrum and are increasingly integrated into tools like Power BI. When using AI in data visualization, several key ethical aspects must be considered and implemented where possible and necessary, these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
Accountability:&#xD;
Establish clear accountability for the decisions made by AI. This includes having human oversight, providing training on the usage of AI data visualization tools and enabling intervention when AI makes incorrect or unethical representations. Furthermore, assign explicit responsibilities for each stage of AI visualization development, require formal signoffs and keep detailed logs to trace decisions and facilitate governance.&#xD;
Accuracy:&#xD;
Ensure that the AI models used are accurate and reliable. This involves regular validation and testing of the models to ensure they produce correct and meaningful visualizations. Furthermore, establish validation protocols to verify AI-generated patterns and avoid false positives. Include clear notes on data limitations and statistical confidence in visual outputs.&#xD;
Bias and fairness:&#xD;
Ensure that AI algorithms used do not introduce or perpetuate biases. This involves careful selection of training data and regular auditing of AI models to detect and mitigate any biases.&#xD;
Contextual integrity:&#xD;
Present data within its appropriate context to prevent misinterpretation. Limit AI systems from making autonomous predictions to reduce bias and enhance transparency. Clearly communicate the limitations, assumptions, and scope of data and models, and avoid repurposing personal data in ways that distorts meaning or erodes trust. Engage subject-matter experts and, where possible, validate interpretations, and use clear labels and framing to maintain context across audiences.&#xD;
Explainability:&#xD;
Ensure that AI-driven results are transparent and interpretable. This helps build trust, supports informed decision-making, and allows users to validate the logic behind the system’s outputs.&#xD;
Privacy:&#xD;
Protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being visualized. This includes anonymizing data and ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently disclosed, especially when working with small population groups or identifiable data. Control access to detailed visual data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.&#xD;
Transparency:&#xD;
Clearly explain how AI is used in the data visualization process, including the algorithms and data sources involved. Users should understand AI’s role, its limitations, and how insights are generated. Regular internal and external audits can help ensure transparency, and consultation with PMD may be beneficial in certain cases.&#xD;
Technical robustness and safety:&#xD;
A key requirements for trustworthy AI is ensuring that systems and software are secure, reliable, and resilient. AI algorithms must be designed to handle errors and inconsistencies across all phases of the system’s lifecycle. This includes implementing safeguards to maintain performance, prevent failures, and ensure the system behaves as intended under a variety of conditions. Furthermore, maintain strict version control and monitoring protocols to prevent unintended consequences or data leaks.&#xD;
Human-in-the-loop:&#xD;
Integrate a mandatory review checkpoint where humans evaluate AI-enabled visuals for ethical and technical soundness. If necessary, form cross-functional teams with expertise in data science, ethics, and communications. Provide training on ethical AI use.&#xD;
Responsible communication:&#xD;

      <documentation>Pricing for 2023 will likely be increased.&#xD;
 - Attempt to find multiple Platinum Sponsors&#xD;
 - DEVELOP A THEME, or possibly ONE THEME PER STREAM&#xD;
 - Charge for each attendee: 1) non-Members of ISACA-CIPS-AEA-etc. 2) Government Worker 3) Public&#xD;
 - Consider paid positions, or pay-by-the-hour model&#xD;
 - Consider changing the time of year of the 4th DTiG; mid-June is competing with other conferences, and Government employees have difficulty securing funds (need 6+ weeks to procure funding, where budgets allow). Is EARLY DECEMBER preferred?&#xD;
 - Should there be an attempt to have even more Speakers, or focus on high quality Speakers?&#xD;
 - Should there be an attempt to make the conference bilingual / have a French Stream each day&#xD;
 - Cutoff Dates for bios / abstracts / presentation decks NEED TO be submitted earlier, and on time&#xD;
 - UofO Location: $1,200 retainer already provided (fully refundable). Administrative help from UofO is probable.&#xD;
 - Shaw Centre would incur additional costs (i.e. for A/V, for food, etc.)&#xD;
 - CONSIDER: Ability to RATE EACH PRESENTATION immediately after each one is done.&#xD;

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.</documentation>

Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.</documentation>

Enterprise Architecture Framework&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework is the criteria used by the Government of Canada enterprise architecture review board and departmental architecture review boards when reviewing digital initiatives to ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures across business, information, application, technology and security domains to support strategic outcomes. The EA Framework came into effect on December 1, 2020 and is a replacement of Appendix A, Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment from the Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework provide details on the requirements set out in the following sections of the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.3 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Prescribing expectations with regard to enterprise architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.4 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Establishing and chairing an enterprise architecture review board that is mandated to define current and target architecture standards for the Government of Canada and review departmental proposals for alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.1.1 of the Directive on Service and Digital. The departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for: Chairing a departmental architecture review board that is mandated to review and approve the architecture of all departmental digital initiatives and ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework will be published on Canada.ca. Until then here is the EA Framework.</documentation>

The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.</documentation>

Overall, the audit found that:&#xD;
     There were weaknesses in departments’ controls for preventing, detecting, and responding to cloud cyberattacks.&#xD;
     The roles and responsibilities for ensuring cloud cybersecurity were unclear.&#xD;
     TBS did not provide departments with a costing model or funding approach for cloud serves.&#xD;
     PSPC and SSC did not include environmental criteria in their procurement of cloud services.&#xD;

      <documentation>Highlights of our RECOMMENDATIONS&#xD;
 - In consultation with Shared Services Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should clarify who is responsible for the initial validation and ongoing monitoring of cloud guardrail controls.&#xD;
 - The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should ensure that the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan applies to the evolving cloud environment and shared responsibilities, review and test it at least annually, and update it as needed.&#xD;
 - In consultation with Shared Services Canada and other departments, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should develop and provide a costing model to help departments make informed decisions about moving to the cloud and Help departments determine their long-term operational funding needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Why we did this audit&#xD;
&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on‑premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised.&#xD;
Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians’ personal information. Departments must work together to protect this information from a number of risks, including cyberattacks.&#xD;
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise, and strong controls to prevent, detect, and respond to them can reduce the risk of breaches.</documentation>

If we automate a few steps in the process, we will reduce the number of person hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
8. Write short, simple sentences&#xD;
Reduce&#xD;
the number of words in your sentences&#xD;
the number of complex words&#xD;
the number of sentences in your paragraphs&#xD;
Include one idea per sentence.&#xD;
Break up long sentences (two is often better than one!).&#xD;
Use online tools to help estimate readability level.*&#xD;

Hemingway&#xD;
Example: Write short, simple sentences&#xD;
Before:&#xD;
It is your responsibility to contact your loan providers to set up a repayment schedule before you have to start making payments after the six month non- repayment period, even though loan providers will try to contact you via mail or phone; it is still your obligation to set up and manage your loan payments should they not be able to reach you. (F-K = 26.5, G-F = 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
After (better):&#xD;
It is your responsibility to contact your loan providers to set up a repayment schedule before the six month non-repayment period is over. Loan providers will try to contact you by mail or phone, but it is your obligation to set up and manage your loan payments. (F-K = 11.3, G-F = 15.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
After (better still):&#xD;
It is up to you to repay your loan. You must contact your loan provider(s) before the six month non-repayment period is over to set up how and when you will repay your loan. (F-K = 6.8, G-F = 10.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
9. Use the active voice&#xD;
Active:&#xD;
The &quot;doer&quot; of the action is right up front.&#xD;
&#xD;
The dog ate the bone.&#xD;
You must name your fear before you can banish it.&#xD;
Passive:&#xD;
The &quot;doer&quot; of the action is near the end of the sentence (or even missing).&#xD;
&#xD;
The bone was eaten. (by the dog?)&#xD;
Named must your fear be before banish it you can. —Yoda quote&#xD;
Example: Use the active voice&#xD;
Before:&#xD;
This is to inform you that the problem was rectified and the issuance of the Monthly Statement of Accounts has been re-established and will continue to be mailed to you on a monthly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
After (better):&#xD;
We have rectified the problem. We will begin to re-issue your Monthly Statement of Accounts and will continue to mail them to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
After (better still):&#xD;
We have fixed the problem. From now on, you will receive a statement every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
Exercise for Tip 9: Spotting the passive voice and using the active voice instead&#xD;
Sentence&#xD;
A request must be made before a refund will be issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
Possible solution&#xD;
&quot;You must request a refund before we can issue it.&quot; or &quot;You must ask for a refund before we can send it.&quot; or &quot;Please fill out the request form and mail it to Service Canada for your refund.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
10. Use formatting and layout to highlight your information and keep your reader's attention&#xD;
Highlight important text.&#xD;
Use headings and sub-headings.&#xD;
Use relevant and meaningful images when appropriate.&#xD;
Include colour to draw attention and create interest.&#xD;
Leave some white space.&#xD;
Choose your font wisely.&#xD;
Use tables to display data when appropriate.&#xD;
Increase the accessibility* of your texts.&#xD;
Suggestions to increase accessibility&#xD;
Fonts:&#xD;
Use sans-serif fonts (e.g. Arial, Verdana) for web content, size 12.&#xD;
Formatting:&#xD;
Include space in your layout, bolded text and bullets for emphasis.&#xD;
Avoid columns, italics, text boxes and tables, if they can be replaced by simple formatting instead.&#xD;
Always apply heading styles to titles and subtitles and apply table headers to your table cells (using options in Word).&#xD;
Colour:&#xD;
Use high contrast colours for text and background, and use patterns along with contrasting colours in tables and graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
See Color Contrast Testerand Color Contrast Spectrum to test combinations and WCAG 2.1 section 1.41. Use of Color for criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
Images, tables and graphs:&#xD;
Provide a) Alternative text (Alt text) or b) good captions and longer descriptions within the text body, below the images.&#xD;

&#xD;
Alt text&#xD;
Add a brief Alt text to all images and objects, if different from the caption or if no caption is included:&#xD;
&#xD;
Format picture, Alt Text configuration window&#xD;
Right click your image/object&#xD;
Select Format Picture/ Object/Chart Area; or select Table Properties for tables&#xD;
Select Alt Text&#xD;
Fill in a brief Description&#xD;
Make sure you answer the question &quot;what information is the image or object conveying?&quot;&#xD;

&#xD;
The Strategy is designed to enable the following results: &#xD;
• Integrated data that enables horizontal lines of sight across our policies, programs, services and channels, resulting in Canadians getting the benefits they are entitled to and ensuring no one is left behind.&#xD;
• The right controls, secure environments and proper data management and governance practices to effectively manage privacy and access, reduce data risk, and ultimately increase citizen trust.&#xD;
• Accelerated use of automation to improve administrative efficiencies and meet or exceed service standards. This is accomplished by considering data up front, using modern data tools, and managing work so that employees can focus on more complex and high priority cases and better serve vulnerable clients. &#xD;
• A culture of transparency that is fostered through open data that drives integrated policies and services, while embedding the sharing of insights, concerns, and best practices in the Department’s culture.&#xD;
• Contextualized data that is fit-for-purpose, timely, discoverable, and properly documented. This enables its timely use to enhance operational efficiency, policy, analysis, research, and evaluation. &#xD;
• Trusted information that is readily accessible and helps senior leaders make timely, data-driven decisions to promptly address emerging priorities and implement service improvements.&#xD;
• Empowered employees with the skills and tools to manage and use data and analytics innovatively, ethically, and responsibly to carry out their work.</documentation>

      <documentation>ESDC’s Data Strategy’s vision is to deliver better outcomes and services for all Canadians by empowering departmental employees to treat data as enterprise assets— shared, protected resources grounded in a culture of data stewardship and collaboration. This will happen in phases as the Department increases its data maturity step-by-step, building on skills and capabilities developed as the Strategy is implemented. In advancing data maturity, the Strategy addresses different challenges faced by the Department, such as data silos and outdated tools and systems, by advancing work under four Service Areas. The implementation of ESDC’s Data Strategy moves us further and further ahead in having access to the right data at the right time and enabling timely decision-making and responsiveness to emerging challenges.

      <documentation>Data Integration Challenges&#xD;
Data integration projects are often conceived at a high level; for example, “Following the merger with our major rival, we will have a large, combined customer base to which we will market our products”. Such simple high-level statements typically omit to mention some difficult problems that Technical Architects and Data Architects must solve. For example, the major rival may well identify its customers in a different way to the group that it is joining, and collect different information about them.&#xD;
This section outlines some of the key data integration challenges.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Grouping" name="Data Integration Context" id="id-401d23b688624f4997f43b2c466fdab6">
      <documentation>Data Integration Context&#xD;
A data integration may be architected as part of a Solution or Capability Architecture development or as part of an Enterprise Architecture development. The TOGAF® Standard (see References) defines an Architecture Development Method (ADM), and its Enterprise Continuum provides an overall context for architectures and solutions, and classifies assets that apply across the entire scope of the enterprise.&#xD;
One of the key aspects of Enterprise Architecture implementation is data migration from the existing to the target environment. The target environment is generally rationalized and streamlined, entailing a major data integration effort to migrate the data.&#xD;
Most data integration architectures are in the organization-specific part of that continuum, guiding and supporting organization-specific data integration solutions. Portals, integrated information environments (An Information Architecture Vision: Moving from Data Rich to Information Smart; see References), information sharing environments, and emerging data fabric/data mesh concepts are common systems architecture concepts, and they guide and support the use of vendor and open source data platforms that are common systems solutions.&#xD;
A data integration is typically preceded by planning, discovery, and extraction, and followed by verification before the integrated data “goes live”. From that point, it is subject to lifecycle management, which determines its storage, use, and eventual disposal. These activities are all carried out in accordance with information governance, as illustrated in Figure 1:&#xD;
• Plan: includes representing information holdings and identifying shortfalls, such as a lack of requisite quality&#xD;
• Discover &amp; Extract: includes analyzing the shortfalls, finding sources and information quality (often through metadata), assessing privacy and legality of extraction, cost-benefit analysis, and getting the information required directly or indirectly (e.g., through data as a service)&#xD;
• Transform &amp; Integrate: includes transforming data into a standard enterprise format, assessing information loss and resultant quality, information sub-integration (e.g., multi-sensor), creating metadata for integrated data, and integration with existing information holdings&#xD;
• Verify: includes establishing the legal/privacy/policy framework, determining whether the integration is legal, determining whether the integration is in line with enterprise values and brand, and determining the need to transform (e.g., anonymize) integrated data&#xD;
• Use: includes operations, decision support, and analytics; for example, Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;Figure 1: Data Integration Context>&#xD;
&#xD;
In a complex case – for example, following a merger – there may be many data integrations carried out in parallel, and the integration may not be a “one-off” event, but a continuous process operating on data that is continually changing. This process may be partly or entirely automated. Establishing such processes can be a significant part of a Solution or Enterprise Architecture.&#xD;
The Technology Architecture phase of a TOGAF architecture development includes the identification of appropriate technical standards. The standards described in this document are candidates for inclusion in the Technology Architecture of an architecture development that covers data integration.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Fabric and Data Mesh&#xD;
A data fabric is an architected system that provides uniform access to data held in multiple, disparate sources. To do this, it uses data integration as the underlying implementation. A data mesh is an architected system which, like a data fabric, uses data integration implicitly, but which need not provide uniform access, and is based on data products. Relatively few enterprises have data fabrics or data meshes today, but their use is growing.</documentation>

      <documentation>Structure Standards&#xD;
According to the Encyclopedia of Computer Science (see References), a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. A data structure standard defines such a collection in general terms, so that it is possible to determine whether a particular collection of data values is an instance.&#xD;
(There are differing definitions of structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data, and the industry has not yet reached consensus on them. Arguably, any collection of data values has some structure. How non-trivial that structure must be for the collection to qualify as structured or semi-structured is for debate.)&#xD;
There are generic data structure standards that can apply to any application domain, and domain-specific data structure standards that define data structures appropriate to specific application domains.</documentation>

      <documentation>API Standards&#xD;
Web service APIs are interfaces for data transmission or exchange using the Web’s HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).4&#xD;
An API client can obtain data from an API or post data to an API. Analysis and transformation software can obtain source data and contextual metadata from APIs, can post integrated data to APIs, or can serve APIs from which integrated data is obtained.&#xD;
There were 22,000 APIs registered with the ProgrammableWeb™ API Directory5 in June 2019, with the number growing at 220 APIs per month. Many domain-specific data structure standards (including FHIR, OFX, and the Open Banking Standard) define data structures used in APIs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Metadata Standards&#xD;
Metadata is data that describes and gives information about other data. It can describe structured data or human-readable content.&#xD;
The Data Management Body of Knowledge (DMBOK®) (see References), defines metadata as “data used to manage and use data”, and says that it “describes what data an organization has, how it is classified, where it came from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves through use, who can and cannot use it, and whether it is of high quality”.&#xD;
Metadata is often used to describe the semantics of data. Semantics can be defined as the meaning or relationship of meanings of a sign or set of signs (Merriam-Webster Dictionary; see References). In the context of data, this is the meaning or relationship of meanings of a data value or collection of data values. Data semantics standards generally assume some kind of data structure.&#xD;
Metadata can also be used to hold information that supports data management and integration processes, such as data synchronization, governance, quality control, defense, and security. For example, creation/modification time information can support data synchronization.&#xD;
Metadata may be provided by a data storage system such as those shown in Table 9.&#xD;

      <documentation>Data Analysis and Transformation Standards&#xD;
Data analysis22 is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.&#xD;
Data transformation23 is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure. Generally, it does so while preserving the semantics of the data.&#xD;
“Datafication” is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data (Cukier; see References). This often includes the transformation of unstructured and semi-structured data into structured data. Examples include natural language processing, computer vision, and signal (e.g., satellite imagery) processing.&#xD;
There are standards that apply to data analysis and transformation professionals and processes, and there are standards for software data analysis and transformation programs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Current Gaps&#xD;
As part of the ongoing efforts to make continuous improvements to service delivery, the Chief Financial Officer Branch (CFOB) is looking to introduce a Debt Overview page and Payment Portal on the My Service Canada Account (MSCA) portal that provides a near live feed of outstanding debts and loans; and offers clients various repayment options. This initiative aims to address several key challenges and opportunities:&#xD;
Manual Processes and Delays: The current system relies heavily on manual processes, leading to delays in updating debtor accounts and processing payments. This inefficiency can result in frustration for clients and increased administrative burden for the Department.&#xD;
Limited Payment Options: Clients currently have limited options for repaying their debts, which can hinder their ability to manage their financial obligations effectively. This often compels clients to opt for payment by cheque or in person, which is costly to process, inconvenient for clients often resulting in processing delays. Providing a wider range of payment options can improve client satisfaction and increase the likelihood of timely repayments.&#xD;
Lack of Real-Time Information: The absence of real-time access to debtor accounts means that clients cannot view their outstanding debts and loans or payment history instantly. This lack of transparency can lead to confusion, disputes over amounts and payment statuses, and duplicate payments of debts. Currently, the client must contact Canada Revenue Agency and/or Service Canada call centres to obtain a real-time account balance.&#xD;
Resource Intensive: Processing unapplied transactions and handling returned mail requires significant resources, diverting time and labor from other critical tasks. Streamlining these processes can free up resources for more value-added activities.</documentation>

      <documentation>Derived Benefits&#xD;
There are multiple opportunities for residual ROI that can't be quantified at this time. The project&#xD;
team envisions significant improvements and a high probability of cost avoidance and savings in&#xD;
the following areas: collectability of debts, increased adoption of electronic statements, and a&#xD;
reduction in lost revenue (i.e., write-offs and remissions).&#xD;
Improved Payment Options: By providing a wider range of payment options, clients will have&#xD;
more flexibility in managing their repayments, increasing the likelihood of timely payments.&#xD;
Real-Time Information: The current lack of real-time access to debtor accounts leads to&#xD;
confusion and disputes over amounts and payment statuses. The RIS project will address this&#xD;
by offering near real-time updates, reducing the need for clients to contact call centers for&#xD;
account balances.&#xD;
Reduced Mailing Costs: By directing clients to MSCA, the adoption rate of electronic&#xD;
statements should increase, reducing the mailing costs associated with the Monthly Statement&#xD;
of Account. (FY2026-27 expected forecast: $6M)&#xD;
Improved Tracing: By accessing their debt information online and making payments, clients&#xD;
will create an online profile, easing the tracing of undeliverable notices, reducing efforts, and&#xD;
encouraging repayment.&#xD;
Avoidance of Lost Revenue: All the benefits listed above will facilitate and encourage the&#xD;
repayment of debt or loans, reducing the number of write-offs and remissions by the&#xD;
department. (FY2023-24: $594M)&#xD;
Resource Efficiency: Streamlining processes such as unapplied transactions and handling&#xD;
returned mail will free up resources for more value-added activities, leading to more efficient&#xD;
debt recovery efforts.</documentation>

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.</documentation>

Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.</documentation>

      <documentation>1.2.7.	Drivers for Change&#xD;
In the first year after its creation, the CDO consulted broadly within ESDC and examined industry trends and challenges faced across Government of Canada (GC).  Numerous challenges were identified by multiple stakeholders, and the following themes emerged:&#xD;
•	The collection, storage and analysis of data is widely dispersed across multiple branches, program areas and regions within the department.  This has many consequences:&#xD;
o	Employees face barriers to accessing information they need to perform analysis that will benefit Canadians and the department&#xD;
o	Privacy controls and transparency of use of data for citizens is inconsistent across data holding and business lines&#xD;
o	Data from different program areas cannot be linked to accurately and efficiently support necessary, authorized policy insights requested by government&#xD;
o	Performance reporting, forecasting and workload management are limited and inconsistent across programs.  There are inadequate performance measures that focus on outcomes.&#xD;
•	Program and project authorities take a tactical “program/project first, enterprise second” view toward data priorities resulting in little or no advancement toward strategic enterprise outcomes.&#xD;
•	Enterprise infrastructure to support advanced and emerging data analytics, for example modern data visualization practices, forecasting, machine learning and artificial intelligence does not exist at the enterprise level and cannot be consistently or effectively implemented in small program/project silos.&#xD;
•	ESDC has a very large investment portfolio with Statistics Canada that is scattered among many divisions and branches.  Data collected from surveys, research and partners is difficult to integrate with program data to derive insights into how the program is responding to intended outcomes, or unintended consequences.&#xD;
•	In some areas where data is accessible and usable, low data literacy is limiting data value.&#xD;
•	Executives, accustomed to managing human and financial resources, lack the understanding, tools and skills needed to manage data as a resource with comparable skill.&#xD;
•	To get work done, employees often extract data from secure systems into network assets such as Excel work sheets to manipulate data.  Executives often do not have clear line of sight into who has access to what data, and for what purpose.  &#xD;
&#xD;
As a result of these and other challenges, ESDC is facing missed opportunities to generate strategic insights, to pursue opportunities, to reduce risks and to realize greater efficiencies.  The department is also challenged to advance its commitment to open up more of its data holdings to the public and Canada’s research community.&#xD;
Resources are limited and must be invested with probity and efficiency.  ESDC must maximize opportunities and investments in data while reducing the burden on its own resources and on Canadian taxpayers.</documentation>

The first step in any business is “know thy customer”.  For ESDC, this entails collecting information through partners, research and surveys to understand our clients: people and businesses.  This information, describing client needs and the operating environment of the business, needs to be integrated with departmental data holdings.  This will enable us to serve our clients, but also to meet the needs of our own executive and our partners.  This critical first step, understanding both business challenges and challenges in domains such as data, policy, technology, etc., forms the first part of foundations: Research, Vision and Strategy comprising five activities:&#xD;
•	Demographic Data Intake Partnerships   Establish the capability to obtain on a continuous basis partner available data that describes the ever-changing operational environment of the business, particularly the client base and their needs.&#xD;
•	Surveys and Research  Identify gaps in available data that describes the operational environment of the business, and act proactively to fill those gaps.&#xD;
•	Data Strategy  Define the path and provisions needed to progress the business management of data as an asset.&#xD;
•	Data Policy  Support the strategy with overarching policy that provides guidance to ensure that organization acts in a manner that is consistent with successful implementation of the strategy.&#xD;
•	Data Governance  Define the roles and procedures that assure the effective management of data, i.e. to ensure that as a critical resource, data is available as needed to support the business and safeguarded to ensure its availability, confidentiality and integrity.  &#xD;

Building a resilient economy: a cleaner &amp; healthier future for our kids&#xD;
&#xD;
Speech from the Throne to open the First Session of the Forty-Fourth Parliament of Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
Congratulations to each of you and welcome to all the new Parliamentarians who will together with their colleagues make their mark on Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.&#xD;
&#xD;
This land acknowledgement is not a symbolic declaration. It is our true history. In each of your own ridings, I encourage you to seek out the truth, and to learn about the lived realities in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. Although each community is distinct, we all share a desire to chart a way forward together towards reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The discovery of unmarked graves of children who died in the residential school system shows how the actions of governments and institutions of the past have devastated Indigenous Peoples and continue to impact them today. We cannot hide from these discoveries; they open deep wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
Despite the profound pain, there is hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is hope in the every day. Reconciliation is not a single act, nor does it have an end date. It is a lifelong journey of healing, respect and understanding. We need to embrace the diversity of Canada and demonstrate respect and understanding for all peoples every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, I have seen how Canadians are committed to reconciliation. Indigenous Peoples are reclaiming our history, stories, culture and language through action. Non-Indigenous Peoples are coming to understand and accept the true impact of the past and the pain suffered by generations of Indigenous Peoples. Together they are walking the path towards reconciliation. &#xD;
&#xD;
We must turn the guilt we carry into action.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on our collective health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on climate change.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our Earth is in danger. From a warming Arctic to the increasing devastation of natural disasters, our land and our people need help. We must move talk into action and adapt where we must. We cannot afford to wait.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the grief and pain of residential schools to the fear of threats to our natural environment to the profound impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this past year has been hard on all of us.&#xD;
&#xD;
I want to thank all workers across Canada, especially those in health care, for their efforts to keep us safe and healthy, and offer my deepest condolences to those who have experienced loss of loved ones during the pandemic. It has touched us all, including those in this chamber who lost a cherished colleague just a few days ago, Senator Forest-Niesing.  To her family and to all of you, my deepest sympathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
The pandemic has shown us that we need to put a focus on mental health in the same way as physical well-being because they are inseparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you begin this 44th Parliament of Canada, and as we recover from the effects of the pandemic and build a better relationship between Indigenous Peoples and non-Indigenous Peoples, I urge you to transform discussion into concrete results for us and for our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Collaborate with and listen to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
Listen to the diverse voices who speak a multitude of languages and who shape this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Confronting the hard questions will not always be easy or comfortable—and it will require conviction—but it is necessary. The outcome will be a sustainable, united Canada, for you, for me, for our children, and for every generation to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
Opening&#xD;
As we speak, British Columbians are facing immeasurable challenges as their homes, their communities, and their well-being are impacted by terrible flooding.&#xD;
&#xD;
But in a time of crisis, we know how Canadians respond. We step up and we are there for each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
And the Government will continue to be there for the people of British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
In 2020, Canadians did not know they would face the crisis of a once-in-a-century pandemic. But, as always, no one should be surprised by how Canadians responded.&#xD;
&#xD;
We adapted. We helped one another. And we stayed true to our values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Values like compassion, courage, and determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Values like democracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
And in this difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Their direction is clear: not only do they want Parliamentarians to work together to put this pandemic behind us, they also want bold, concrete solutions to meet the other challenges we face.&#xD;
&#xD;
Growing an economy that works for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fighting climate change.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Moving forward on the path of reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Making sure our communities are safe, healthy, and inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, the decade got off to an incredibly difficult start, but this is the time to rebuild.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment for Parliamentarians to work together to get big things done, and shape a better future for our kids.   &#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to build a healthier today and tomorrow&#xD;
Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, the Government has mandated vaccination for federal and federally-regulated workers, and for everyone travelling within Canada by plane, train, or ship. It has also ensured a standardized Canadian proof of vaccination for domestic and international use.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is securing next generation COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and doses for kids from 5 to 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
And around the world, Canada will continue working with its partners to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines and other resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build a healthy future, we must also strengthen our healthcare system and public health supports for all Canadians, especially seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities, and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is work to be done. On accessibility. On care in rural communities. On delayed procedures. On mental health and addiction treatment. On long-term care. On improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions and get the best possible results.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will work collaboratively with provinces, territories, and other partners to deliver real results on what Canadians need.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to grow a more resilient economy&#xD;
The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good. But as we do, we should rebuild an economy that works for everyone. At the height of the lockdowns, the Government made historic, necessary investments so families could keep paying the rent and small businesses could stay afloat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, with one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, and employment back to pre-pandemic levels, the Government is moving to more targeted support, while prudently managing spending.&#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure no one is left behind, support will be extended or added for industries that continue to struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also continue making life more affordable for all Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inflation is a challenge that countries around the world are facing. And while Canada’s economic performance is better than many of our partners, we must keep tackling the rising cost of living. To do that, the Government’s plan includes two major priorities: housing and child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whether it is building more units per year, increasing affordable housing, or ending chronic homelessness, the Government is committed to working with its partners to get real results.  &#xD;
&#xD;
For example, the Housing Accelerator Fund will help municipalities build more and better, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also help families buy their first home sooner with a more flexible First-Time Home Buyer’s Incentive, a new Rent-to-Own program, and by reducing the closing costs for first-time buyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting families will make life more affordable for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Canada Child Benefit has already helped lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and will continue increasing to keep up with the cost of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue building the first-ever Canada-wide early learning and child care system. By the end of 2022, average fees for regulated child care will be cut in half in most of the provinces and territories. And in some places, this will even happen as early as the start of the year. Families will save thousands of dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four jurisdictions have not yet reached agreements on child care. Two are territories with unique infrastructure challenges, and the Government will keep working together to ensure we meet the needs of the North. The Government will continue working with the remaining two provinces to finalize agreements that will deliver $10-a-day child care for families who so badly need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in affordable child care – just like housing – is not just good for families. It helps grow the entire economy. And so does immigration.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will continue increasing immigration levels and reducing wait times, while supporting family reunification and delivering a world-leading refugee resettlement program.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment for bolder climate action&#xD;
Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries – we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.  &#xD;
&#xD;
As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world’s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.   &#xD;
&#xD;
As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians’ pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada’s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to fight harder for safer communities&#xD;
While we address climate change –&#xD;
&#xD;
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences –&#xD;
&#xD;
While we grow our economy for everyone –&#xD;
&#xD;
We cannot turn away from other challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.&#xD;
&#xD;
During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone should be – and feel – safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will continue combatting hate and racism, including with a renewed Anti-Racism Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to stand up for diversity and inclusion&#xD;
Canadians understand that equity, justice, and diversity are the means and the ends to living together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fighting systemic racism, sexism, discrimination, misconduct, and abuse, including in our core institutions, will remain a key priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue to reform the criminal justice system and policing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to rebuild for everyone. The Government will continue to invest in the empowerment of Black and racialized Canadians, and Indigenous Peoples. It will also continue to fight harmful content online, and stand up for LGBTQ2 communities while completing the ban on conversion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Canadians, our two official languages are part of who we are.  &#xD;
&#xD;
It is essential to support official language minority communities, and to protect and promote French outside and inside Quebec.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will reintroduce the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English and the Strengthening of the Official Languages Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support Canadian culture and creative industries, the Government will also reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act and ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to move faster on the path to reconciliation&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth. As the Government continues to respond to the Calls to Action, it will invest in that truth, including with the creation of a national monument to honour survivors, and with the appointment of a Special Interlocutor to further advance justice on residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support communities, the Government will also invest significantly in a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy, guided by Indigenous Peoples, survivors, and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone in our country deserves to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will accelerate work with Indigenous partners to address the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also make sure communities have the support they need to keep families together, while ensuring fair and equitable compensation for those harmed by the First Nations Child and Family Services program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Reconciliation requires a whole-of-government approach, breaking down barriers, and rethinking how to accelerate our work. Whether it is eliminating all remaining long-term drinking water advisories or implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Government is committed to closing the gaps that far too many First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities still face today.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to fight for a secure, just, and equitable world&#xD;
The last 19 months have underscored that we live in a deeply interconnected world.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada must stand up on the pressing challenges of our time, through our own commitments and by increasing our engagement with international partners, coalitions, and organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the face of rising authoritarianism and great power competition, Canada must reinforce international peace and security, the rule of law, democracy, and respect for human rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s prosperity – and middle class jobs – depend on preserving and expanding open, rules-based trade and ensuring our supply chains are strong and resilient.&#xD;
&#xD;
At home, the Government will continue to protect Canadians from threats to our communities, our society, and our democracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
A changing world requires adapting and expanding diplomatic engagement. Canada will continue working with key allies and partners, while making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and across the Arctic.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing Canada’s foreign assistance budget each year, and investing in sustainable, equitable, and feminist development that benefits the world’s most vulnerable and promotes gender equality will continue to be priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
We will always stand up for a brighter future for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
This decade is still young. With compassion, courage, and determination, we have the power to make it better than how it started.&#xD;
&#xD;
But that can only happen by standing together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Parliamentarians, never before has so much depended on your ability to deliver results for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is what people expect and need from you.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition to ending this pandemic, their priorities for this 44th Parliament are clear: a more resilient economy, and a cleaner and healthier future for all of our kids.&#xD;
&#xD;
I do not doubt that you will honour the trust that has been placed in you.&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may you be equal to the profound trust bestowed on you by Canadians, and may Divine Providence guide you in all your duties.&#xD;

Subject: FW: Changements à la haute direction de la DGIIT / IITB Senior Leadership Changes&#xD;
&#xD;
Bonjour à tous,&#xD;
&#xD;
À la suite des annonces d'aujourd'hui de la haute direction envoyées par nos sous-ministres (ci-joint), j'aimerais vous fournir du contexte et des renseignements supplémentaires sur ce que l'ajout de deux nouveaux sous-ministres adjoints signifie pour nous tous à la DGIIT, pour le reste de notre ministère et à la communauté numérique élargie du gouvernement du Canada (GC).&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout d'abord, permettez-moi de féliciter Rina Lorello et Nasser Alsukayri pour leurs nominations à venir à leurs nouveaux postes au sein de la DGIIT. Comme annoncé, Rina sera nommée sous-ministre adjointe et dirigeante principale de l'information déléguée (DPID) et Nasser sera nommé sous-ministre adjoint, Responsable du changement technique (Programme de modernisation du versement des prestations) et dirigeant principal de l'information délégué.&#xD;
&#xD;
C'est une excellente nouvelle pour nous tous. Ces nominations reconnaissent plusieurs choses.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	EDSC subit actuellement une transformation massive de ses services, comme vous le savez. Le rôle de la DGIIT dans ce travail est suffisamment important – nous devons nous assurer que tous les éléments informatiques substantiels de notre transformation sont livrés, que ce soit par notre équipe ou par nos partenaires de prestation de services. Ce travail est de la plus haute priorité pour notre ministère, pour le GC et, en fait, pour les Canadiens.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	La plus grande initiative de notre transformation est la Modernisation du versement des prestations (MVP). Les sous-ministres ont souligné le rôle important que la DGIIT joue dans la MVP à de nombreuses reprises, y compris l'annonce en 2020 de mon rôle - désormais assumé par Nasser - en tant que Responsable du changement technique dans le programme de la MVP, avec des responsabilités spécifiques envers le Dirigeant principal de la transformation. Le travail informatique dans la MVP est un mandat complet en soi, et il prendra bientôt de l'ampleur à mesure que nous commencerons la mise en œuvre de la Sécurité de la vieillesse dans la MVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Alors que notre ministère et notre direction générale sont occupés à la transformation, la DGIIT a également la très grande tâche de continuer à faire fonctionner et à maintenir les services informatiques essentiels qui sous-tendent tout. EDSC est souvent qualifié de « portefeuille » et non seulement de ministère, pour une très bonne raison : nous sommes énormes. Nos opérations informatiques sont relativement importantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Nos programmes et services, ainsi que les systèmes informatiques qui les exécutent, ne sont pas statiques – il y a des changements tout le temps. EDSC a un portefeuille d'environ 50 grands projets actuellement en cours et de nombreux petits projets. Presque tout ce travail implique la DGIIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enfin, la taille, la stature, l'importance d'EDSC et le très bon travail que nous faisons font de nous un chef de file dans la communauté numérique du GC. Nous pouvons faire plus dans notre communauté élargie pour partager nos réussites, nos pratiques exemplaires et nos leçons avec les autres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout compte fait, à la DGIIT, collectivement, nous avons l'un des mandats informatiques les plus visibles, les plus difficiles et les plus importants du pays. Rina et Nasser apportent tous deux un leadership supplémentaire et diversifié à notre direction générale pour nous aider dans notre important travail.&#xD;
&#xD;
De votre point de vue, en tant qu'employés de la DGIIT, l'ajout de Rina et Nasser dans leurs nouveaux rôles ne changera pas beaucoup votre vie professionnelle quotidienne – il n'y a pas de changement organisationnel en cours ici. La DGIIT continuera comme une seule organisation, avec un DPI pour le ministère. Les deux nouveaux DPID et moi travaillerons ensemble comme une seule équipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bien que le nouveau rôle de Nasser soit noté ici (la DGIIT dans la MVP), Rina, Nasser et moi prendrons les prochaines semaines pour déterminer la responsabilité de toutes les activités et les priorités de la direction générale. Nous partagerons plus d'informations à ce sujet avec vous dès qu'elles seront disponibles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rina, Nasser et moi nous engageons à veiller à ce que les informations soient partagées régulièrement et, plus important encore, en temps opportun. À cette fin, nous prévoyons une rencontre et une discussion ouverte à la mi-juin, pendant ou à proximité de la Semaine nationale de la fonction publique. Les détails de cette rencontre seront transmis dans les prochains jours.&#xD;
&#xD;
Veuillez vous joindre à moi pour féliciter Rina et Nasser pour leurs nominations à venir.&#xD;
&#xD;
Merci,&#xD;

***************************************************&#xD;
&#xD;
Hello Everyone, &#xD;
 &#xD;
Following today’s senior leadership announcements made by our Deputy Ministers (attached), I would like to provide you with some additional context and information about what the addition of two new Assistant Deputy Ministers means to all of us in IITB, to the rest of our Department, and to the broader Government of Canada (GC) digital community.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, let me congratulate Rina Lorello and Nasser Alsukayri for their upcoming appointments to their new positions within IITB. As announced, Rina will be appointed as Assistant Deputy Minister and Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO) and Nasser will be appointed as Assistant Deputy Minister, Technical Change Authority (Benefits Delivery Modernization Programme), and Deputy Chief Information Officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is great news for all of us. These appointments recognise several things.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	ESDC is undergoing a massive service transformation right now, as you know.  IITB’s role in this work is suitably large – we must ensure that all of the substantial IT elements of our transformation are delivered, whether by our team or by our service delivery partners.  This work is of highest priority in our Department, and for the GC and indeed for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The largest initiative in our transformation is Benefits Delivery Modernisation (BDM).  The DMs have signalled the important role that IITB has in BDM on many occasions, including the 2020 announcement of my role – now to be assumed by Nasser – as Technical Change Authority in the BDM programme, with specific accountabilities to the Chief Transformation Officer.  The IT work in BDM is a full mandate of and in itself, and it will soon grow larger as we begin the implementation of Old Age Security in BDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	While our Department and our Branch are busy transforming, IITB also has the very large job of keeping running and maintaining the essential IT services that underpin everything.  ESDC is often referred to as a “portfolio” and not just a department, for very good reason: We are enormous.  Our IT operations are comparably large.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Our programs and services, and the IT systems that run them, are not static – there is change all the time.  ESDC has a portfolio of roughly 50 major projects currently underway, and numerous smaller ones.  Nearly all of this work involves IITB.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Lastly, ESDC’s size, stature, importance, and the very good work that we do makes us a leader in the GC digital community.  There is more that we can do in our broader community to share our successes, best practices, and lessons with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
All to say, in IITB, collectively, we have one of the biggest, most challenging, and most important IT mandates in the country.  Both Rina and Nasser bring additional and diverse leadership to our Branch to help in our important work.&#xD;
&#xD;
From your perspective, as IITB employees, the addition of Rina and Nasser in their new roles here will not change your daily work life much – there is no organisational change happening here.  IITB will continue as one branch, with one CIO for the department.  The two new DCIOs and I will work together as one team.&#xD;
&#xD;
While Nasser’s new role is noted here (IITB in BDM), Rina, Nasser and I will take the next few weeks to determine the responsibility for all of the Branch’s activities and priorities.  We will share more information on this with you as soon as it is available.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Rina, Nasser and I are committed to ensuring that information is shared regularly and, more importantly, in a timely fashion. To that end, we are planning a meet and greet town hall for mid-June, in or near National Public Service Week.  Details on this meeting will be sent in the coming days.&#xD;
&#xD;
Please join me in congratulating Rina and Nasser on their upcoming appointments. &#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you, &#xD;
&#xD;

        <documentation>Caption: National Public Service Week 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
Hello Everyone,&#xD;
  &#xD;
Happy National Public Service Week 2022!  This week is an opportunity for all of us to recognize and celebrate the efforts and leadership of public servants from across the country. &#xD;
&#xD;
At management tables and speaking to employees across the country, we regularly hear positive feedback about your efforts. Many IITB employees are on the front lines of the services ESDC employees use regularly, as well as those upon which Canadians rely. What you do really matters; it keeps ESDC up and running and ensures Canadians get the support they need when they need it. &#xD;
&#xD;
As the Department has grown in recent years, you have stepped up to meet the challenge of increased demand for information technology (IT) and information management (IM) services. Whether that’s by providing the equipment and software employees need to do their jobs remotely or in the office, ensuring our systems and data remain safe, or managing the IM and IT aspects of the many projects we support, you have shown resilience in keeping up with ESDC’s needs throughout the pandemic, while also feeling its effects personally.&#xD;
&#xD;
We are constantly impressed by your dedication and commitment to service. We are proud to be public servants, proud to lead IITB, and proud to work with such a talented and hardworking team. &#xD;
&#xD;
We encourage you to take some time this week and participate in the virtual activities that recognize your efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
We look forward to seeing you and taking your questions at the IITB Town Hall on June 15. Event details are included in a calendar invitation you would have received earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
We encourage you to also attend a live, bilingual, virtual “Ask Me Anything” Deputy Ministers’ Town Hall that will be open to everyone in ESDC on June 16 from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we approach summer, we hope that you will take time for yourselves with your loved ones and recharge. Thank you for all that you have done.  &#xD;

PURPOSE&#xD;
The purpose of this presentation is to provide an update and seek feedback on the cloud operationalization framework, including GC Cloud Guardrails v2.0, Public Cloud Roles and Responsibilities, and SOP for Guardrails Validation, Escalation and Oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
BACKGROUND&#xD;
• In August 2019, the Government of Canada (GC) established supply contracts for Protected B Cloud Services with AWS Canada and Microsoft Azure.&#xD;
• For the GC to consume this supply securely and responsibly, the Chief Technology Officer of the GC deemed that an underlying operationalization framework was required.&#xD;
• In September 2019, the GC Cloud Operationalization Framework was approved by GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB). This included the establishment of a set of minimal security controls and architecture prior to departments consuming Pro B supply in the form of GC Cloud Guardrails.&#xD;
• The GC Cloud Guardrails are a set of controls focused on ensuring departments have implemented a minimum set of protections in their cloud environment focused on access management, network perimeter, segmentation, and monitoring. These Guardrails are needed in addition to a security assessment and an Authority To Operate (ATO).&#xD;
• In May 2022, the GC Cloud Guardrails were mandated under the Directive on Service and Digital Appendix G: Standard on Enterprise Information Technology Service Common Configurations.&#xD;
• In November 2022, the Office of the Auditor General’s (OAG) audit Report recommended the GC clarify the process and roles/responsibilities for validating and monitoring Cloud Guardrails and extend these to PSPC procured solutions (see Appendix A for details).&#xD;
• To support the Management Action Plan (the GC’s response), TBS, SSC, and PSPC initiated an activity to update the GC Cloud Guardrails.</documentation>

Standard personal information banks&#xD;
Personal information banks (PIBs) are descriptions of personal information under the control of a government institution that is organized and retrievable by an individual's name or by a number, symbol or other element that identifies that individual. The personal information described in a PIB has been used, is being used or is available for an administrative purpose. The PIB describes how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, retained and/or disposed of in the administration of a government institution's program or activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are three types of PIBs: central, institution-specific and standard. The following descriptions are standard PIBs. They describe information about members of the public as well as current and former federal employees contained in records created, collected and maintained by most government institutions in support of common internal services. These include personal information relating to human resources management, travel, corporate communications and other administrative services. Standard PIBs are created by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Individuals seeking access to the institution-specific Personal Information Banks of a particular government institution should consult the institution’s Info Source chapter (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/list-institutions.html).&#xD;

        <documentation>ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026&#xD;
https://esdc.prv/en/news/adms-champions/2025/02/05-01.shtml&#xD;
&#xD;
The world is constantly evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities that shape the way we live and work. Whether it’s adapting to global challenges or embracing the latest technological advancements, these changes push us to think differently and act with intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Chief Data Officer at ESDC, I’ve seen first-hand how data can improve how we deliver programs and services to Canadians. Data tells a story about the people we serve and the impact of the programs and services that we deliver. By harnessing the power of data—not just as a tool, but as a foundation for smarter, more meaningful actions—we can enhance efficiency and ensure our work aligns with the needs and realities of those we serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since launching one of the first Chief Data Offices in the Government of Canada in 2016, and establishing the Chief Data Officer Branch (CDOB) in 2023, ESDC has been on a journey of growth, learning and innovation. These were not just operational changes—they also marked a culture shift. This journey marked ESDC’s commitment to treating data as shared resources that help our department solve tough problems, innovate responsibly and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
One example of how we’ve leveraged data to improve outcomes is by linking data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. This initiative identified $192 million in unclaimed benefits for children of deceased CPP contributors or those with disabilities, demonstrating how a data-driven approach can improve effectiveness and ensure Canadians receive the benefits they’re entitled to.&#xD;
&#xD;
With that in mind, I am proud to share the ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026, CDOB’s roadmap for advancing organizational data maturity. This strategy outlines the Department’s approach to meeting the needs of the organization and the people we serve. It formalizes our commitment to treating data as a shared strategic asset that drives innovation and boosts productivity across the policy–service continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a world that is always changing, data drives our decisions and shapes understanding of the links between our policies, programs and services and the people they impact. Using data responsibly and effectively guides us through challenges and toward meaningful solutions. I am proud to be part of this journey and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.&#xD;

As Chief Data Officer at ESDC, I’ve seen first-hand how data can improve how we deliver programs and services to Canadians. Data tells a story about the people we serve and the impact of the programs and services that we deliver. By harnessing the power of data—not just as a tool, but as a foundation for smarter, more meaningful actions—we can enhance efficiency and ensure our work aligns with the needs and realities of those we serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since launching one of the first Chief Data Offices in the Government of Canada in 2016, and establishing the Chief Data Officer Branch (CDOB) in 2023, ESDC has been on a journey of growth, learning and innovation. These were not just operational changes—they also marked a culture shift. This journey marked ESDC’s commitment to treating data as shared resources that help our department solve tough problems, innovate responsibly and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
One example of how we’ve leveraged data to improve outcomes is by linking data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. This initiative identified $192 million in unclaimed benefits for children of deceased CPP contributors or those with disabilities, demonstrating how a data-driven approach can improve effectiveness and ensure Canadians receive the benefits they’re entitled to.&#xD;
&#xD;
With that in mind, I am proud to share the ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026, CDOB’s roadmap for advancing organizational data maturity. This strategy outlines the Department’s approach to meeting the needs of the organization and the people we serve. It formalizes our commitment to treating data as a shared strategic asset that drives innovation and boosts productivity across the policy–service continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a world that is always changing, data drives our decisions and shapes understanding of the links between our policies, programs and services and the people they impact. Using data responsibly and effectively guides us through challenges and toward meaningful solutions. I am proud to be part of this journey and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.&#xD;

May 21, 2025&#xD;
Office of the Prime Minister&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Colleagues:&#xD;
Last month, Canadians elected a new Government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone. As members of the 30th Ministry, we must fulfill this mandate with purpose and force. We must meet a series of unprecedented challenges with both a disciplined focus on core priorities and new approaches to governing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Context: A Generational Challenge&#xD;
Canada faces a series of crises. In a more dangerous and divided world, geopolitical risks are rising, threatening our sovereignty. The global trading system – which has helped power Canada’s prosperity for decades – is undergoing the biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall. At home, our longstanding weak productivity is straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely.&#xD;
&#xD;
The new federal Government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must redefine Canada’s international, commercial, and security relationships. In the process, we need to develop a defence industrial policy that secures Canada, fulfills our responsibilities to our allies, and helps build our economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada must build an enormous amount of new infrastructure at speeds not seen in generations. This includes the infrastructure to diversify our trading relationships; to become an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energies; to restore affordability to housing; and to secure our borders and our communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The combination of the scale of this infrastructure build and the transformative nature of artificial intelligence (AI) will create opportunities for millions of Canadians to find new rewarding careers – provided they have timely access to the education and training they need to develop the necessary skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
Government itself must become much more productive by deploying AI at scale, by focusing on results over spending, and by using scarce tax dollars to catalyse multiples of private investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our Priorities&#xD;
We will focus on seven priorities:&#xD;
&#xD;
Establishing a new economic and security relationship with the United States and strengthening our collaboration with reliable trading partners and allies around the world.&#xD;
Building one Canadian economy by removing barriers to interprovincial trade and identifying and expediting nation-building projects that will connect and transform our country.&#xD;
Bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them to get ahead.&#xD;
Making housing more affordable by unleashing the power of public-private cooperation, catalysing a modern housing industry, and creating new careers in the skilled trades.&#xD;
Protecting Canadian sovereignty and keeping Canadians safe by strengthening the Canadian Armed Forces, securing our borders, and reinforcing law enforcement.&#xD;
Attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.&#xD;
Spending less on government operations so that Canadians can invest more in the people and businesses that will build the strongest economy in the G7.&#xD;
Working Together&#xD;
We must deliver for Canadians as a team committed to real Cabinet government. The attainment of these objectives will require collaboration and coordination within Cabinet. I expect each Cabinet committee, led by their Chair, to drive and monitor our progress, with oversight from the Priorities, Planning and Strategy Committee, and direction from the full Cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
While fulfilling your core responsibilities as a member of the Ministry, you should identify how specifically you can contribute to these missions. You will be expected and empowered to lead, and to bring new ideas, clear focus, and decisive action to your work. Over the coming weeks, I will look to each of you to identify the key goals and measures of success on which to evaluate the results you will achieve for Canadians as a member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
We will work together with Parliamentarians and the public service. We will work in true partnership with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples. And we will bring together labour, business, and civil society to build a Canada worthy of our children and grandchildren.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addressing the tasks before us, we must remain true to Canadian values. Canada is a dynamic country that celebrates our diversity, cares for the most vulnerable among us, and strives for a better future for all. The new federal Government will continue the vital work of advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples. We will fight climate change. We will uphold the rule of law, protect our democratic institutions, and reinforce the unity of our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s challenges are not small, but we can more than meet them with vigour and a constructive approach. That is how Canadians have built the best country in the world. That is how we will build it to be even better.&#xD;
&#xD;
In partnership,&#xD;
Prime Minister of Canada signature&#xD;
The Rt. Hon. Mark Carney,&#xD;
Prime Minister of Canada&#xD;

Speech from the Throne to open the first session of the 45th Parliament of Canada&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
It is with a sense of deep pride and pleasure that my wife and I join you here today, as we witness Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride, unity, and hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people. This land acknowledgement is a recognition of shared history as a nation. While continuing to deepen my own understanding, it is my great hope that in each of your communities, and collectively as a country, a path is found toward truth and reconciliation, in both word and deed.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is my 20th visit to Canada, spread over the course of more than half a century, and my first as Sovereign. As I have said before, “Every time I come to Canada… a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart.” I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada’s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values, and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
To the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples – you have welcomed my family and myself to your traditional lands with great warmth and hospitality, for which I am humbly grateful.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, we mark the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and V-J Day. On Juno Beach, at Dieppe, on the Somme, at Beaumont-Hamel, at Ypres, and on Vimy Ridge… At those places, and many others, forever etched into our memories, Canadians fought and died alongside our closest allies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Today, I see representatives from every part of Canada – from St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to Victoria, British Columbia, and Arviat, Nunavut. I see the guardians of the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Canadian Charter and, as King, I thank you for your service to your fellow Canadians, across the length and breadth of this vast and great nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
You speak for your communities, representing an incredible richness of cultures, languages, and perspectives. We owe it to this generation, and those who succeed us, to think and act for the greater good of all. While the world faces unprecedented challenges, generating uncertainties across the continents with regards to peace and stability, economics, and climate change, your communities have the skills and determination to bring a wealth of solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
By fostering collaboration and engaging in respectful, constructive debates, you will ensure this Government is capable of bold and fair action to support Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
It has been nearly 70 years since the Sovereign first opened Parliament. In the time since, Canada has dramatically changed: repatriating its Constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth. Canada has embraced its British, French, and Indigenous roots, and become a bold, ambitious, innovative country that is bilingual, truly multicultural, and committed to reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present. As it should, it stands proudly as a symbol of Canada today, in all her richness and dynamism.&#xD;
&#xD;
Opening&#xD;
When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory. The Cold War was intensifying. Freedom and democracy were under threat. Canada was emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world. In the decades since, history has been punctuated by epoch-making events: the Vietnam War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the start of the War on Terror. Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect.&#xD;
&#xD;
The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada’s relationships with partners are also changing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must be clear-eyed: the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War. Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling. Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity. An opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War. A confident Canada, which has welcomed new Canadians, including from some of the most tragic global conflict zones, can seize this opportunity by recognising that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away. And that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Building new relationships with the United States and the world&#xD;
The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government is working to strengthen its relationships with reliable trading partners and allies around the world, recognizing that Canada has what the world needs and the values the world respects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada is ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries that share its values, that believe in international co-operation and the free and open exchange of goods, services, and ideas. In this new, fast-evolving world, Canada is ready to lead. This will be demonstrated in June, when Canada convenes the G7 Summit.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a more affordable Canada&#xD;
The Government is guided by its conviction that the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone. Many Canadians are struggling to get ahead. The Government is responding, reducing middle-class taxes and saving two-income families up to $840 a year. It will cut the GST on homes at or under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, delivering savings of up to $50,000. And it will lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect the programs that are already saving families thousands of dollars every year. These include child care and pharmacare. In addition to these, the Government has recently expanded the Canadian Dental Care Plan to cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a stronger Canada&#xD;
The Government’s overarching goal – its core mission – is to build the strongest economy in the G7. That starts with creating one Canadian economy out of thirteen. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year. The Government will introduce legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility by Canada Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Numerous premiers have already taken vital steps to break down provincial and territorial barriers to trade. Together, we will build on that progress to deliver free trade across the nation by Canada Day. This is critical to unlocking Canada’s full economic potential, but it’s not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build Canada strong, the Government is working closely with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples to identify and catalyse projects of national significance. Projects that will connect Canada, that will deepen Canada’s ties with the world, and that will create high-paying jobs for generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Given the pace of change and the scale of opportunities, speed is of the essence. Through the creation of a new Major Federal Project Office, the time needed to approve a project will be reduced from five years to two; all while upholding Canada’s world-leading environmental standards and its constitutional obligations to Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also strike co-operation agreements with every interested province and territory within six months to realize its goal of “one project, one review.”&#xD;
&#xD;
When Canadians come together, Canada builds things that last.&#xD;
&#xD;
By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don’t just survive ongoing trade wars, but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world’s leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change. To build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the skilled trades. And to build Canada into the world’s leading hub for science and innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Critically, the Government will undertake a series of measures to help double the rate of home building while creating an entirely new housing industry – using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, and Canadian lumber. The Government will introduce measures to deliver affordable homes by creating Build Canada Homes. This mission-driven organization will act to accelerate the development of new affordable housing. It will invest in the growth of the prefabricated and modular housing industry. And it will provide significant financing to affordable home builders. The Government will make the housing market work better, including by cutting municipal development charges in half for all multi-unit housing. The Government will drive supply up to bring housing costs down.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a safer and more secure Canada &#xD;
To be truly strong, Canada must be secure. To that end, the Government will introduce legislation to enhance security at Canada’s borders. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will have new tools to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors. The Canada Border Services Agency will be given new powers to examine goods destined for export, to prevent the transport of illegal and stolen products, including cars.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect Canada’s sovereignty by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will boost Canada’s defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada’s European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad. To keep communities safe, the Government will hire 1,000 more RCMP personnel. It will change firearms licensing and strengthen enforcement of yellow and red flag laws. Weapons licences for those convicted of intimate partner violence and those subject to protection orders will be revoked. Through the deployment of scanners, drones and helicopters, additional personnel, and K-9 teams, the Government will stem the tide of illegal guns and drugs across the border.&#xD;
&#xD;
It will take these steps while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners and Indigenous Peoples’ longstanding hunting traditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will bring a renewed focus on car theft and home invasions by toughening the Criminal Code to make bail harder to get for repeat offenders charged with committing these crimes, along with human trafficking and drug smuggling.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a united Canada&#xD;
During this time of great change, Canadians are uniting behind what makes Canada unique.&#xD;
&#xD;
The French language and the Quebec culture are at the heart of the Canadian identity. They define the country that Canadians and I love so much. Canada is a country that respects and celebrates its official languages and Indigenous languages. The Government is determined to protect the institutions that bring these cultures and this identity to the world, like CBC/Radio-Canada. It will protect the people who give us access to fresh, healthy, and quality food: agricultural producers. And it will protect supply management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nature is core to Canada’s identity. In 2022, Canada convened COP15 in Montréal, which concluded with 196 countries striking a historic agreement to protect 30 percent of their lands and 30 percent of waters by 2030. To this end, the Government will protect more of Canada’s nature than ever before through the creation of new national parks, national urban parks, marine protected areas, and other conservation initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will always protect the rights and freedoms that the Charter guarantees for every Canadian.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will be a reliable partner to Indigenous Peoples, upholding its fundamental commitment to advancing reconciliation. Central to this commitment is the creation of long-term wealth and prosperity with Indigenous Peoples. For that reason, the Government will double the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program from $5 billion to $10 billion – enabling more Indigenous communities to become owners of major projects. As Canada moves forward with nation-building projects, the Government will always be firmly guided by the principle of free, prior, and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s immigration system has long been a source of pride for Canadians and of dynamism for the economy. The Government is dedicated to rebuilding the trust of Canadians in immigration by restoring balance to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will cap the total number of temporary foreign workers and international students to less than five percent of Canada’s population by 2027. By doing this, the Government will attract the best talent in the world to build our economy, while sending a clear message to Canadians working abroad that there is no better time to come home.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building Canada Strong by spending less and investing more&#xD;
In all of its actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can invest more.&#xD;
&#xD;
Day-to-day government spending – the government’s operating budget – has been growing by nine percent every year. The Government will introduce measures to bring it below two percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Transfers to provinces, territories, or individuals will be maintained. The Government will balance its operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication, and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government will take a series of measures to catalyse new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. The scale of the Government’s initiative will match the challenges of our times and the ambitions of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
When my dear late mother addressed your predecessors seven decades ago, she said that in that age, and against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself. It is a source of great pride that, in the following decades, Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.&#xD;
&#xD;
I wish to express to you and to the people of Canada my heartfelt gratitude, and that of my wife, for the warmth of the welcome which we have received.&#xD;
&#xD;
As the anthem reminds us: The True North is indeed strong and free!&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.&#xD;
&#xD;
May you honour the profound trust bestowed upon you by Canadians, and may God bless and guide you in all your duties.&#xD;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xD;
This business case demonstrates the value of a new Data Collection System (DCS) for the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy (YESS). The YESS was modernized in 2019 to adapt to emerging labour market conditions and improve outcomes for youth facing barriers to employment. To support modernization, a new Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) has been implemented. In order to support this, the Department requires the new DCS to continue the collection, storage and analysis of program data for the YESS from its twelve horizontal delivery partners. There was a previous DCS, however it was decommissioned due to system security issues, lack of ability to make meaningful performance measurement updates, and severe technical debt. The YESS-DCS is necessary to support core program functions such as meeting reporting and evaluation requirements. It will also help grow the program's impact for Canadian youth by allowing for easier, timelier access to better data about program outcomes and allowing for adaptive policy/program responses.</documentation>

Subject: RE: EMAS: IT continuity&#xD;
&#xD;
Sorry to interject, but there’s an element here I really need to clarify. The upcoming implementation of the departmental Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is *not* a replacement for the Corporate Solution Directory (CSD). They’re two very different things.&#xD;
&#xD;
Over the years since the CSD was introduced as a tool to support APM’s reporting to TBS, it became a de facto CMDB only because of the urgent need for one in the branch and the lack of a proper enterprise CMDB. The CSD was never designed or intended for that use, and with the upcoming implementation of the CMDB, we will finally be able to transition configuration data away from the CSD to something fit-for-purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
That transition will also be a key milestone in the evolution of the CSD itself to tools that are more fit-for-purpose and specific to APM’s areas of responsibility, which is why we will be able to decommission that legacy CSD tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
In short, configuration management data will come from the CMDB (managed by Paul Lalonde) and the Service Asset and Configuration Management (SACM) team to be put in place to support it, while APM data will continue to come from the next phase (which we’re calling Bifrost) of our APM tooling journey. &#xD;
&#xD;
Obviously, it’s still vital that anyone currently consuming data or information from the CSD today have a full accounting of what they’re pulling, so that they can engage with the APM team accordingly. We don’t want anyone to be left unaware or unprepared for these transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Incidentally, I saw there was question in the EMAS chat about how to source contact data. As part of our APM tooling, we have changed from position names to position numbers, which allows us to update application  contact data with some measure of automation on a monthly basis using extracts from PeopleSoft. This provides a much higher level of reliability, since the data is coming from the authoritative source and no longer relies upon IT managers making manual updates to the corresponding records in the CSD. As a proof-of-concept, our success with this illustrates the advantages for other teams that need access to up-to-date HR data to follow in our footsteps.&#xD;

        <documentation>Executive Summary&#xD;
Following the 2023 budget proposal to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) to provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians, the CDCP will:&#xD;
· provide Canadians the ability to apply and be considered access to the CDCP for their oral heath needs,&#xD;
· seek help and guidance on eligibility, how to apply and information on the program, and&#xD;
· maintain or renew their status throughout the year.&#xD;
This business case details the CDCP business need, business context, background, options analysis, evaluation criteria, and solution scope to deliver the solution project.&#xD;
&#xD;
Business Context Diagram Description&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes providing $13 billion over five years, starting in 2023-24, and $4.4 billion ongoing, to Health Canada (HC) to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP). The CDCP will provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians with an annual family income of less than $90,000, with no co-pays for those with family incomes under $70,000. &#xD;
It is estimated that approximately 9 million Canadians will be eligible for the CDCP. (Family income &lt;$90k, resident of Canada, no access to a comparable dental insurance plan). The CDCP will be an insurance program delivered via a third-party benefits administrator (TPA). The CDCP will be launched in phases, starting with a targeted eligible population of seniors, people with disabilities, and people under 18 (totaling 4.7M) in 2024. Seniors and persons with disabilities should be prioritized for coverage as of April 1, 2024. In addition, children under 12* must be enrolled and be able to access dental coverage under the Canada Dental Care Plan as of July 1, 2024. (given that the existing interim dental benefit for children under 12 ends July 1, 2024). Full program eligibility for all families within an income less than $90,000 and who do not have access dental care through an employer, pension or private plan will start January 2025. &#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC/Service Canada (SC) is entering in a partnership agreement to deliver services on behalf of HC to Canadians as the plan starts up and on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
HC is the lead for program implementation and works in collaboration with ESDC/Service Canada and partners on this implementation. This business case encompasses the CDCP service delivery implementation project that will deliver the required capabilities to intake CDCP applications, process applications and determine eligibility, communicate the decision to applicants and provide client support in the Service Canada network. The capabilities will support delivery of the following target client experience and flow: &lt;May 4, 2023 Service Delivery Process Flow Diagram (A-to-H)></documentation>

 &#xD;
Légende : Message de la ministre – Un message pour les employés d’EDSC&#xD;
Chers collègues,&#xD;
Il y a 20 ans cette semaine, le gouvernement fédéral a pris une grande décision : créer Service Canada, en tant que point d’accès unique où les Canadiens pourraient recevoir un vaste éventail de prestations et de services gouvernementaux conçus pour les aider à traverser toutes les étapes de la vie.&#xD;
Depuis 20 ans, Service Canada remplit cette mission, et en a fait bien plus encore. Par téléphone, en personne dans les Centres Service Canada, aux sites de services mobiles dans les communautés, et dans les coulisses de nos centres de traitement, Service Canada a été une présence fiable dans tout le pays, jour après jour, même dans les circonstances les plus difficiles. Les exemples suivants ne sont que quelques-unes des façons dont Service Canada change la donne :&#xD;
Renforcer le filet de sécurité sociale du Canada&#xD;
Personne ne devrait être laissé pour compte dans notre pays. Service Canada joue un rôle essentiel pour éliminer les obstacles et créer des possibilités économiques pour tous. C’est pourquoi, à un moment où faisons face aux graves conséquences de la guerre commerciale avec l’un de nos plus importants partenaires commerciaux, l’assurance-emploi demeure la pierre angulaire du filet de sécurité sociale du Canada en soutenant les travailleurs lorsque survient une perte d’emploi, un congé parental ou une maladie ou lorsqu’ils doivent assumer des responsabilités d’aidant naturel.&#xD;
Élargir l’accès aux programmes essentiels&#xD;
Service Canada continue d’élargir l’accès à des programmes essentiels qui favorisent la santé et le bien-être financier des Canadiens. Le lancement du Régime canadien de soins dentaires a ouvert la voie à des soins dentaires abordables aux personnes admissibles à travers le pays. Plus récemment, Service Canada a amorcé le traitement des demandes pour la Prestation canadienne pour les personnes handicapées, qui offre du soutien financier direct aux personnes en situation de handicap. &#xD;
Ce travail va au-delà de l’équité, il s’agit de créer un véritable changement, de favoriser l’autonomie des individus et d’aider les Canadiens à bâtir un avenir plus solide en leur permettant de s’épanouir pleinement.&#xD;
Moderniser et améliorer la prestation des services&#xD;
À mesure que les besoins des Canadiens évoluent, Service Canada a élargi son offre afin de fournir du soutien plus accessible et plus réactif. L’une des principales avancées a été l’amélioration des outils libre-service pour les clients de la Sécurité de la vieillesse (SV). Aujourd’hui, plus de 7,4 millions de Canadiens peuvent demander des prestations de la SV en ligne, mettre à jour leurs renseignements personnels, télécharger des documents et accéder à leurs relevés fiscaux ou les télécharger, le tout grâce à un service numérique simplifié. &#xD;
Notre force, ce sont nos employés&#xD;
Que ce soit en offrant du soutien à des millions de Canadiens, en assurant l’accès à des prestations et services ou en retroussant nos manches en situation de crise nationale comme la pandémie de COVID 19, les employés de Service Canada sont toujours à la hauteur de la tâche par leur dévouement, leur compassion et leur professionnalisme.&#xD;
Ce 20e anniversaire, c’est davantage qu’un chiffre. C’est l’occasion de rendre hommage aux personnes qui œuvrent dans l’ombre du nom de Service Canada, aux personnes qui travaillent, jour après jour, pour offrir aux Canadiens le soutien dont ils ont besoin. L’engagement à servir le public n’est pas toujours facile à respecter, mais d’avoir la confiance des Canadiens au quotidien est une récompense plus que suffisante.&#xD;
Notre objectif pour l’avenir : renforcer la promesse faite par le gouvernement aux Canadiens et rendre les services gouvernementaux plus inclusifs, accessibles et axés sur le public.&#xD;
La contribution que vous apportez est inestimable et instrumentale au succès du Canada, génération après génération.&#xD;
Merci pour tout votre travail et bravo pour ces 20 années au service de notre pays et de nos collectivités.&#xD;

Caption: Minister’s Message – A message for ESDC employees&#xD;
Dear colleagues,&#xD;
Two decades ago, the federal government took an important step to establish Service Canada as a single point of access where Canadians could receive a wide range of government benefits and services designed to support them through life’s many transitions.&#xD;
For 20 years, Service Canada has fulfilled that mission—and done so much more. By phone, in-person at Service Canada Centres, at community outreach sites, and behind the scenes in our processing centres, Service Canada has been a reliable presence across the country—day in and day out—even in the most challenging circumstances. The following examples highlight just some of the ways Service Canada is making a difference:&#xD;
Strengthening Canada’s social safety net&#xD;
Nobody should be left behind in this country. Service Canada’s role is critical in breaking down barriers and building economic opportunity for all. That is why, as we’re navigating the serious consequences of the trade war with one of our most important trade partners, Employment Insurance (EI) remains a cornerstone of Canada’s social safety net, supporting workers through job loss, parental leave, illness and caregiving responsibilities. &#xD;
Expanding access to essential programs&#xD;
Service Canada continues to broaden access to vital programs that support Canadians’ health and financial well-being. The launch of the Canadian Dental Care Plan has opened the door to affordable dental care for eligible individuals across the country. More recently, Service Canada began processing applications for the Canada Disability Benefit, delivering direct financial support to persons with disabilities.&#xD;
This work goes beyond fairness—it’s about creating meaningful change, empowering individuals, and helping Canadians build a stronger future by unlocking their full potential.&#xD;
Modernizing and improving service delivery&#xD;
As Canadians’ needs continue to evolve, Service Canada has expanded its offerings to provide more accessible and responsive support. One key advancement has been the enhancement of self-serve tools for Old Age Security (OAS) clients. Today, more than 7.4 million Canadians can apply for OAS benefits online, update personal information, upload documents and access or download their tax slips—all through a streamlined digital service. &#xD;
Our strength is our people&#xD;
Whether it’s providing support to millions of Canadians to ensuring access to benefits and services or stepping up during times of national crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, Service Canada employees have consistently shown that they are up to the task through their dedication, compassion and professionalism.&#xD;
This 20-year anniversary goes far beyond a number, it's a celebration of the people behind the name, those who work to make sure Canadians have the support they need. Commitment to public service isn’t always easy, but earning the trust of Canadians every day makes it all worth it. &#xD;
As we move forward, let’s build on the Government’s commitment to Canadians: to make government services more inclusive, accessible and focused on people. &#xD;
Your contributions are highly valued and instrumental to Canada’s success, across generations.&#xD;
Thank you for your work, and congratulations on 20 years of service to our country and communities. &#xD;
&#xD;

Implementing FAIR and CARE Data Principles (DDN3-A12)&#xD;
Description&#xD;
This article explores the FAIR and CARE principles, their relevance in the workplace, and how the Government of Canada is implementing them to enhance data accessibility, compatibility, and ethical stewardship.&#xD;

&#xD;
Implementing FAIR and CARE Data Principles&#xD;
The Government of Canada has long been entrusted with managing vast and diverse data, from health records and census data to environmental statistics and national security intelligence. This data is essential to shaping policies and improving the lives of Canadians. In recent years, the volume and complexity of this data have grown at an unprecedented rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
With this data explosion comes a new set of challenges. People in Canada, civil society organizations, and even global watchdogs are demanding greater transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship of this valuable resource. How should the government collect, store, and use this data responsibly? This is where the FAIR principles—focused on making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—become a crucial framework for navigating the evolving landscape of public data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
What are the FAIR principles?&#xD;
The FAIR principles, developed by a coalition of researchers, data stewards, and institutions in the academic and public sectors in 2016, are a set of best practices designed to make data valuable and usable over time. They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
Findable: Data should be easy to find by both humans and machines.&#xD;
Accessible: Data should be available in a usable format with clear access protocols and constraints.&#xD;
Interoperable: Data must be compatible across different systems and formats.&#xD;
Reusable: Data should be structured and documented in such a way that others can easily and appropriately reuse it for further analysis or innovation.&#xD;
In 2020, the Government of Canada released the Roadmap for Open Science, urging all federal departments and agencies to develop strategies and tools for implementing the FAIR data principles. The goal was to improve the interoperability of research data across the public sector. Building on this momentum, Health Canada, along with other federal bodies, integrated these principles into Health Canada's Open Science Action Plan, which officially launched in 2022. And in 2025, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat published the Guidance on Assessing Readiness to Manage Data According to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Principles which provides recommendations on how to apply the FAIR principles in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, the FAIR principles, while promoting open data, do not fully address issues related to power imbalances and historical context. To complement FAIR, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance introduced the CARE principles—collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics. These principles ensure that data practices support Indigenous innovation and self-determination, emphasizing ethical stewardship and the importance of Indigenous Peoples' rights. By integrating CARE alongside FAIR, the aim is to empower Indigenous communities and respect their sovereignty in data governance.&#xD;
&#xD;
The CARE principles&#xD;
Implementing the FAIR principles in your work&#xD;
You've learned about the FAIR principles—now, how do you bring them to life in your work? The following strategies will help you maximize the value of your data.&#xD;
&#xD;
Findable: Make your data easy to locate&#xD;
&#xD;
Metadata is key: Always include detailed, standardized metadata—clear descriptions, tags, and keywords—that improve searchability. Definition1&#xD;
Persistent identifiers: Use permanent identifiers (like digital object identifiers) to ensure your data is easily retrievable in the long term. Definition2&#xD;
Publish data in repositories: Upload your data to trusted and searchable platforms (such as the Government of Canada's open data platform) so that it's accessible to stakeholders and the public.&#xD;
Accessible: Ensure data is available when needed&#xD;
&#xD;
Open access first: Prioritize making data publicly accessible. If restrictions apply (for example, because of privacy or security concerns), provide clear access mechanisms and justifications.&#xD;
Guarantee long-term access: Store data in sustainable formats and reliable platforms to preserve its usability in the future.&#xD;
Interoperable: Make your data work seamlessly across computer systems&#xD;
&#xD;
Standardize formats: Use widely accepted file formats like CSV, JSON, and XML to ensure compatibility across platforms.&#xD;
Align with established standards: Use common vocabularies and taxonomies to reduce confusion and enhance data exchange.&#xD;
Enable data linkages: Allow data linkage to other relevant datasets.&#xD;
Reusable: Maximize the potential of your data&#xD;
&#xD;
Clear licensing: Apply transparent, open licenses (for example, Creative Commons or the Government of Canada's Open Government Licence - Canada) so others know how they can use your data.&#xD;
Provide thorough documentation: Offer detailed explanations about how the data was created, its methodology, and its limitations, to support responsible use.&#xD;
Facilitate data use: Organize data so that it's easy to analyze, reformat, or combine with other datasets.&#xD;
Integrating the CARE principles&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition to FAIR, consider the ethical implications covered in CARE:&#xD;
&#xD;
Respect Indigenous perspectives: When working with data related to Indigenous communities, follow the CARE principles—ensure respect for Indigenous knowledge and collective benefit.&#xD;
Champion ethical stewardship: Prioritize fairness and accountability, particularly with sensitive or personal data. Protect privacy and be transparent about data usage.&#xD;
These are high-level starting points. To go further into CARE, and into Indigenous considerations around data, consider reading our articles and taking courses found in the resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
Benefits&#xD;
Organizing data to be easily found, accessed, and reused not only saves time but also helps you make smarter, more informed decisions that drive better outcomes. With seamless data sharing, collaboration becomes easier, and the public can trust that their government is working in their best interest. By storing data in sustainable formats, you future-proof it for long-term use, ensuring it remains valuable for future decision-makers. This easy access to data sparks innovation and creative solutions, driving progress in the public sector. Ultimately, the FAIR principles foster transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship, building public trust in government.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
The adoption of FAIR and CARE principles represents a significant step towards responsible data stewardship in Canada, particularly as the country embraces open data initiatives. FAIR ensures that government data is accessible, interoperable, and reusable, fostering efficiency and collaboration across sectors. At the same time, CARE addresses ethical considerations, particularly with regard to Indigenous data sovereignty and collective benefit, ensuring that open data practices respect the rights and needs of all communities. As Canada continues to refine its data strategies, the challenge will be ensuring that these principles translate into meaningful action. Governments and agencies must remain proactive in balancing the goals of open data with their ethical responsibilities, ensuring transparency, security, and respect for diverse communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Definition&#xD;
Definition 1&#xD;
Metadata: Provides information about a file or piece of content, such as who created it, when it was created, its file size, or the type of content. In other words, it is data that describes other data. For example, for a photo, the metadata might include the date the photo was taken, the camera settings used, and the location where it was taken. Metadata helps organize, find and manage data more easily.&#xD;

10 PIPEDA Principles Explained: A Quick Guide to Privacy Compliance&#xD;
Understanding the principles of PIPEDA is crucial for organizations to meet customer expectations and legal standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA is a Canadian law relating to data privacy. PIPEDA governs how private sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information during commercial business activities. It became effective in April 2000 and seeks to balance an individual’s right to privacy with the need of organizations to collect and use personal information for legitimate business purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our guide explains the 10 PIPEDA principles, which are crucial for data privacy compliance. We aim to simplify the complex data protection concepts and give you a concise and easy-to-understand overview. Our goal is to empower you to stay up-to-date with the evolving data protection landscape without feeling overwhelmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
pipeda principles&#xD;
What is the PIPEDA in Canada?&#xD;
PIPEDA stands for the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. A federal privacy law in Canada governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by private sector organizations. PIPEDA came into effect on January 1, 2004, and it applies to organizations that engage in commercial activities and operate across provincial or national borders.&#xD;
&#xD;
The key principles of PIPEDA include:&#xD;
&#xD;
Consent: Organizations must obtain the individual’s consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal information, except in certain specific circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accountability: Organizations are responsible for the personal information under their control and must designate individuals accountable for the organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose Limitation: Personal information must be collected for specified purposes and should not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the individual’s consent or as required by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
Accuracy: Organizations must make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
Safeguards: Organizations must implement security safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
Openness: Organizations must be open about their privacy policies and practices, making information about these readily available to individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
Individual Access: Individuals have the right to access their personal information held by an organization and to challenge its accuracy if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
Challenging Compliance: Individuals have the right to challenge an organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA. Organizations must have procedures in place to respond to such challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA applies to the private sector, but some provinces have enacted similar legislation that applies to the public sector within those provinces. Organizations need to understand and comply with PIPEDA to protect individuals’ privacy rights in collecting and using their personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
How Does PIPEDA Compare to Other Data Protection Laws Worldwide?&#xD;
PIPEDA, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, is similar in many ways to data protection laws worldwide, especially those based on common principles like consent, accountability, and transparency.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, some key differences and nuances exist when comparing PIPEDA to other data protection laws worldwide, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States’ various state-specific privacy laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
Consent Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA, like many other data protection laws, requires organizations to obtain individuals’ consent to collect, use, and disclose their personal information. Consent under PIPEDA can be expressed or implied, depending on the circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR, however, places a higher emphasis on explicit and unambiguous consent. It also provides additional requirements, such as the right to withdraw consent easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
Extraterritorial Application:&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR has extraterritorial applicability, meaning it applies to organizations outside the European Union (EU) that process the personal data of EU residents if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA applies to organizations engaged in commercial activities across provincial or national borders in Canada. While it has some extraterritorial reach, it does not have the same global scope as GDPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data Subject Rights:&#xD;
&#xD;
Both PIPEDA and GDPR provide individuals with certain rights regarding their personal information. These include the right to access, correct, and delete their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR grants additional rights such as the right to data portability, the right to be forgotten, and the right to object to certain types of processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data Breach Notification:&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA includes mandatory data breach notification requirements, whereby organizations must report breaches to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and notify affected individuals when a breach poses a risk of significant harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR mandates data breach notifications to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach, and in certain cases, individuals must be informed without undue delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
Penalties and Enforcement:&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA does not have the same level of fines as GDPR. While the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has the authority to investigate and issue recommendations, it does not have the power to impose significant fines.&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR imposes substantial fines for non-compliance, with penalties that can amount to a percentage of the organization’s global annual turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sectoral vs. Comprehensive Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
PIPEDA is a sectoral law applying primarily to the private sector and certain federal works, undertakings, and businesses. Provinces in Canada may have their privacy legislation covering the public sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
GDPR is a comprehensive law covering all sectors and uniformly across the EU member states.&#xD;
&#xD;
Compared to the United States, where there is no comprehensive federal privacy law, individual states have started enacting their privacy legislation, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and subsequent laws in other states.&#xD;
&#xD;
What are the main principles of PIPEDA?&#xD;
Principle 1 – Accountability&#xD;
The principle of accountability in PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) outlines organizations’ responsibility in protecting the personal information they collect, use, and disclose. The accountability principle is the first of the ten principles set forth in PIPEDA and establishes the foundation for the other principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 2 – Identifying Purposes&#xD;
The principle of identifying purposes is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the importance of organizations being transparent and upfront about the reasons for collecting personal information. The goal is to ensure that individuals know and understand why their information is being collected, used, or disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 3 – Consent&#xD;
The principle of consent is a fundamental aspect of Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). This principle governs organizations’ collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, emphasizing the importance of obtaining the individual’s consent as a key element of respecting privacy rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 4 – Limiting Collection&#xD;
The principle of limiting collection is a fundamental aspect of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle outlines the requirement for organizations to limit the collection of personal information to what is necessary for the purposes identified. The goal is to ensure that organizations do not indiscriminately gather more personal information than is needed for their stated objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 5 – Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention&#xD;
The PIPEDA principle of limiting use, disclosure, and retention is part of the broader framework that governs the protection of personal information under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. This principle establishes guidelines for organizations regarding the appropriate use, disclosure, and retention of personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 6 – Accuracy&#xD;
The principle of accuracy is one of the fundamental principles outlined in PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the importance of ensuring that personal information collected by organizations is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 7 – Safeguards&#xD;
The principle of safeguards is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle emphasizes the responsibility of organizations to implement measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and alteration. The goal is to ensure the security and confidentiality of individuals’ personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 8 – Openness&#xD;
The principle of openness, also known as the principle of transparency, is a fundamental component of Canada’s PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). This principle emphasizes the importance of organizations being open and transparent about their privacy policies, practices, and procedures related to collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 9 – Individual Access&#xD;
The principle of individual access is a key component of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle grants individuals the right to access their personal information held by organizations and allows them to challenge the accuracy and completeness of that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Principle 10 – Challenging Compliance&#xD;
The PIPEDA principle of challenging compliance addresses the right of individuals to challenge an organization’s compliance with the principles of PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) in Canada. This principle is sometimes called the “Challenging Compliance” or “Individual Recourse” principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
Do I Need to Comply with the PIPEDA Principles?&#xD;
As of the update in January 2022, PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is a Canadian federal privacy law that governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by private sector organizations during commercial activities. However, please note that my information might be outdated, and it’s important to check for any changes or updates to the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
As a general guideline, PIPEDA applies to private sector organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal information during commercial activities, unless a province has enacted its own substantially similar privacy legislation. Some provinces, such as British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, have enacted their own privacy laws; in those cases, PIPEDA may not apply directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
To determine whether you need to comply with PIPEDA, consider the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
Type of Organization: PIPEDA typically applies to private sector organizations engaged in commercial activities.&#xD;
Jurisdiction: PIPEDA is a federal law, but if your business operates in a province with substantially similar privacy legislation (e.g., Alberta, British Columbia), you may need to comply with the provincial law instead.&#xD;
Interprovincial or International Activities: If your business operates across multiple provinces or engages in international activities, PIPEDA may be applicable.&#xD;
Nature of Information: PIPEDA covers collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. If your organization deals with personal information, PIPEDA compliance is likely necessary.&#xD;
Please check the most recent legal resources or consult with legal professionals to ensure accurate and up-to-date information regarding your specific situation and jurisdiction.&#xD;

Further Reading&#xD;
There are many definitions of “open” and this is but one. The 2007 working group’s definition sits at the unique intersection of open government and open data and has United States sensibilities.&#xD;
For a broader notion of open data, see the Open Definition (2005).&#xD;
See the resources at the right, and continue reading below for annotated principles of open government data and other principles found around the web.&#xD;
