      <documentation>In order to encourage a culture of &quot;Working in the Open&quot;, and the sharing of software development projects, ESDC is developing an Open Source Software (OSS) Management Framework to guide employees. To this effect, the IT Strategy and IT Research team within ESDC has begun working in the open. Existing project teams are increasingly looking to share their source codes and work in the open (e.g. CDO, CAWS). More than 50 GitHub source code repositories have been shared (32 Developer Experience, 11 Developer Community of Practice [DevCoP] and 9 Service Canada). The DevCoP has numerous repositories on GcCode and GitHub, indicating ESDC’s efforts to both promote and align with the DOSP - working in the open, collaborating widely, using open standards and solutions. Over 99% of EI applications are currently submitted through digital methods. In addition, the Pensions projects (especially CPP-SIS) are further advancing the availability of e-services for that client segment as well.</documentation>

      <documentation>In order to guide and shape how government information, technology and service delivery will be managed in a new digital ecosystem, ESDC is undertaking the following initiatives:&#xD;
   CSLP – E-Service Re-Procurement;&#xD;
   Temporary Foreign Worker System and Webservice Enhancements 2.0; and,&#xD;
   CSLP - New Brunswick SIN Validation. &#xD;
&#xD;
These initiatives will help build a set of digital standards into policy, operations and program development.&#xD;
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ESDC created and rapidly deployed the e-service and eSIN applications. Currently, over 99% of EI applications are currently submitted through digital methods. Additionally, Pensions projects, such as CPP-SIS, are further advancing the availability of e-services for that client segment.</documentation>

      <documentation>TB’s Policy on Service and Digital is estimated to have 247 requirements applying to the departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) function. Along with this are key changes, which produce new expectations for Deputy Heads in the areas of service, information and data, technology, cyber security, as well as workforce capacity and capability. To comply with the Policy, a methodological gap analysis was performed by IITB teams to determine the policy-driven requirements based on five themes: &#xD;
 Governance, planning and reporting (as it relates to IT governance and planning within ESDC);&#xD;
 Service Design and Delivery;&#xD;
 Information and Data;&#xD;
 Technology (including automated decision making); and,&#xD;
 Cyber Security and Identity.&#xD;
The gap analysis looked at IITB’s existing investments and priorities and made 12 recommendations for IITB to either create new initiatives or reprioritize its portfolio of activities. Most of these recommendations are already in progress as part of the IITB Way Forward. The top five prioritized recommendations are:&#xD;
 Clarify the role and responsibilities between the CDO and the CIO;&#xD;
 Establish the role of a designated official for Cyber Security (DOCS);&#xD;
 Review IM/IT and Identity Policies to address redundancy, conflicts, user-centered policy writing, and training;&#xD;
 Harmonize the different service inventories for a single source of truth; and,&#xD;
 Formalize automated decision-making governance at ESDC.&#xD;
These recommendations reflect the integrated management of functions as expected by the Policy, the increased responsibilities of the CIO, and the unique governance entities within ESDC (e.g. use of a CDO, a Chief Security Officer outside the branch of the CIO, and a tier 2 level committee focused on purely on service). &#xD;
In addition, the Branches within the Department have been collaborating internally to improve service delivery and digital transformation:&#xD;
 Business Architecture and Alignment Office participates regularly at EA activities as one of the EA domains in developing project architectures; &#xD;
 User Experience Team provides UX research and design services to IT project teams regularly; and,&#xD;
 Business Process Management Team provides guidance and services on business process mapping to IT project teams regularly.</documentation>

      <documentation>In support of ESDC’s Accessibility Strategy, ESDC is working on and testing an interdepartmental initiative to replace existing GC tools to ensure availability of more accessible toolsets, where such collaborative tools (i.e. Office 365) used for accessibility follow internationally recognized accessibility standards. ESDC is also working to ensure interoperability of adaptive technologies with the ESDC collaboration toolset. These digital collaboration tools are required for Canadians with disabilities as they continue to face barriers to their full participation in the workplace, which limit their opportunities for career development and advancement.</documentation>

      <documentation>Via the Infrastructure Re-use Branch Initiative, connectivity between the legacy ESDC infrastructure and data centres to the SSC End State data centres is being made available as a selfprovisioning service to allow the migration of certain applications. Further work, resources and funds under the WLM Project will need to be engaged to migrate specific ESDC workloads of the legacy data centres to SSC End State data centres.&#xD;
In order to complete the migration of the specific ESDC workloads of the legacy data centres to SSC’s End State data centre, the following projects are being migrated as part of the WLM project: &#xD;
 1-800 O-Canada Business Model Review and Contract ReProcurement; &#xD;
 Emergency Management Application System; &#xD;
 ESDC’s Cloud Implementation Plan is underway to support the departmental application strategy, data centre consolidation and cloud adoption. This includes the Cloud Assessment Framework, Research and Prototyping, and the Cloud Intake process; and,&#xD;
 Making all internal applications accessible over the next three years is a significant outcome of ESDC’s Application Strategy.</documentation>

Through its implementation, the Department aims to provide people with easy, secure, and authorized access to quality data in a way that protects privacy and delivers value for Canadians. &#xD;
The Strategy is built on six foundations for improved client service and policy: access, analytics, data governance and stewardship, data management, enablement, and people.&#xD;
Foundations investments include among others:&#xD;
 Master data management (MDM) expansion; &#xD;
 Purchase and installation of ESDC Data Catalogue;&#xD;
 Procurement of SAS (VA);&#xD;
 Data Visualization for Business Solutions; and,&#xD;

CYBERSECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE CLOUD&#xD;
Federal government must strengthen its use of controls to prevent, detect, and respond to threats on personal information stored in the cloud&#xD;
Report 7 | Reports of the Auditor General of Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
At a Glance&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on-premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised. Overall, we found that the requirements the government had in place to reduce the security risks of storing information in the cloud were not always followed by the departments we audited. In addition, these requirements and their corresponding roles and responsibilities were not always clear, resulting in inconsistent implementation and increased risks. This is important because the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has directed departments to consider moving applications and databases to the cloud, so increasing amounts of Canadians’ personal information are moving there. At the same time, cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The risk of significant impacts on the government and its operations is growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The government must take immediate action to strengthen how it prevents, detects, and responds to cyberattacks. It should do this now, while departments are still in the early stages of moving personal information to the cloud. This action includes strengthening key security controls to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches. It also includes clarifying shared roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity—which are highly complex in a cloud environment—so that all departments know exactly what they should be doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We also found that, 4 years after the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat first directed departments to consider moving to the cloud, it had still not provided a long-term funding approach for cloud adoption. It had also not given departments tools to calculate the costs of moving to or of operating in the cloud and securing the information stored in it. Departments need both a funding approach and costing tools to ensure that the people, expertise, skills, training, funding, and other resources they need to secure cloud-based information are available to prevent and address the greatest threats and risks. A funding approach and costing tools are essential for cloud adoption and would strengthen Canada’s cyber-defence capabilities both at the departmental level and government-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
   Why we did this audit&#xD;
&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on‑premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised.&#xD;
Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians’ personal information. Departments must work together to protect this information from a number of risks, including cyberattacks.&#xD;
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise, and strong controls to prevent, detect, and respond to them can reduce the risk of breaches.&#xD;
   Our findings&#xD;
&#xD;
There were weaknesses in departments’ controls for preventing, detecting, and responding to cyberattacks.&#xD;
The roles and responsibilities for ensuring cloud cybersecurity were unclear and incomplete.&#xD;
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat did not provide departments with a costing model or funding approach for cloud services.&#xD;
Public Services and Procurement Canada and Shared Services Canada did not include environmental criteria in their procurement of cloud services.&#xD;
   Key facts and figures&#xD;
&#xD;
Departmental spending on cloud services government-wide has increased significantly year over year, from $35 million in 2018 to almost $120 million in 2021.&#xD;
Digital technologies are expected to be responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and for up to 14% by 2040.&#xD;
The 3 departments we selected for this audit were using a variety of short-term funding measures to support their cloud and cybersecurity operations, including reallocating funds that had been intended for other purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
   Highlights of our recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
In consultation with Shared Services Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should clarify who is responsible for the initial validation and ongoing monitoring of cloud guardrail controls.&#xD;
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should ensure that the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan applies to the evolving cloud environment and shared responsibilities, review and test it at least annually, and update it as needed.&#xD;
In consultation with Shared Services Canada and other departments, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should develop and provide a costing model to help departments make informed decisions about moving to the cloud and Help departments determine their long-term operational funding needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Towards a New Disability Benefit&#xD;
Since 2015, the government has taken steps towards building an inclusive and resilient economy that supports people with disabilities. In addition to enacting groundbreaking legislation to create a barrier-free Canada, the government has also taken concrete steps to help people with disabilities receive enhanced programming and access to benefits, savings plans, and education funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
The pandemic has exposed many of the long-standing challenges persons with disabilities face, including an increased risk of poverty. The Government of Canada has a number of programs and services in place that provide support to Canadians with disabilities but these are often complex and can be difficult to navigate for users. To ensure all persons with disabilities have the support they need to overcome persistent barriers to full economic and social participation, the government is committed to bringing forward a new disability benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2021 proposes to provide $11.9 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to Employment and Social Development Canada to undertake consultations to reform the eligibility process for federal disability programs and benefits. This will help maximize the reach of these programs and improve the lives of Canadians living with disabilities. This work would feed directly into the design of a new disability benefit.&#xD;
In preparation for legislation, the government will undertake extensive consultations with stakeholders on the design of the new benefit and engage with provinces and territories, which play a central role in providing support to many Canadians with disabilities. Employment and Social Development Canada will also establish a steering committee to oversee the development of this work, alongside the Canada Revenue Agency, the Department of Finance Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada.</documentation>

      <documentation>Advancing Inclusion of Canadians with Disabilities&#xD;
In October 2022, the government launched the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to disability inclusion. Community engagement is a key aspect—the government needs to get views from Canadians with disabilities in matters that affect them. To further enhance disability inclusion in Canada:&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes to provide $10 million over two years, beginning in 2023-24, to Employment and Social Development Canada to help address the unique needs and ongoing barriers faced by persons with disabilities by investing in capacity building and the community-level work of Canada's disability organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes to provide $21.5 million in 2023-24 to Employment and Social Development Canada to continue work on the future delivery of the Canada Disability Benefit, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process.&#xD;
&#xD;
The government remains committed to the launch of a Canada Disability Benefit as part of the Disability Inclusion Action Plan, including engagement with the disability community and provinces and territories on the regulatory process. Investments in Budget 2023 continue to lay the necessary groundwork for the Canada Disability Benefit, building off of the government's reintroduction of the Canada Disability Benefit Act in June 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting Canadians With Disabilities&#xD;
The federal government provides significant support to Canadians with disabilities. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
More than $1.6 billion per year to support persons with severe and prolonged mental and physical impairments through the Disability Tax Credit;&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $1 billion per year through Canada Disability Savings Grants and Bonds, as well as exempting from tax investment income earned in Registered Disability Savings Plans, which supports the financial security of persons with disabilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
Providing $922 million to provinces and territories through the Workforce Development Agreements in 2023-24, approximately 30 per cent of which is targeted to help persons with disabilities get training, develop their skills, and gain work experience;&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $650 million annually through more generous Canada Student Grants, interest-free Canada Student Loans, and easier-to-access repayment assistance—including loan forgiveness for those with severe permanent disabilities—to support persons with disabilities with the additional costs of post-secondary education, such as those that come with supportive services and devices;&#xD;
&#xD;
$105 million in 2023-24 to support the implementation of an employment strategy for persons with disabilities through the Opportunities Fund. This included funding to the Ready, Willing and Able Program to support persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder or intellectual disabilities in finding employment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
Over $460 million per year through the Child Disability Benefit provided as a supplement to the Canada Child Benefit for parents of children with severe and prolonged disabilities, providing an average of approximately $2,700 in annual support.&#xD;
&#xD;
Along with the proposed Canada Disability Benefit Act, these measures form part of the government's Disability Inclusion Action Plan, which aims to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities.</documentation>

It’s time to build a future that makes Canada strong. We can give ourselves much more than any foreign government, including the United States, can ever take away. Building one Canadian economy, for example, can expand our economy by up to $200 billion — proof that we are strongest when we are united. Elbows up.&#xD;

A Throne Speech fit for a king. But where's the budget?&#xD;
The federal government still has time to fix this and produce a spring budget&#xD;
&#xD;
Colin Busby, Nicholas Dahir and William Robson&#xD;
Colin Busby is director, policy engagement, of the C.D. Howe Institute, where Nicholas Dahir is a research officer and William Robson is president and CEO.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Speech from the Throne delivered by King Charles III on Tuesday will be remembered as an anomaly, and not just because of the speaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here's how it usually goes: A Throne Speech opens a legislative session, laying out the government's priorities. Then, at the start of that legislative session, the government presents a budget to provide key fiscal context for its priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The annual budget is the cornerstone of the government's financial and economic management. It provides the big picture within which specific choices - notably the spending MPs must approve in the estimates - should fit. Without a budget, Canadians cannot properly assess the legislative priorities, including the cuts to personal income taxes and the GST specifically mentioned in the Throne Speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the government, instead of committing to delivering a budget at the start of the legislative session, has delayed it until the fall. The budget could be up to half a year away. It is highly unusual for a Throne Speech to not be followed by a budget for so long.&#xD;
&#xD;
It does not have to be this way. Or, at least, the government still has time to fix it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ottawa had previously decided to not even present a budget this year. The federal government's turnabout to deliver a 2025 budget is good news - but not good enough. While better than no budget at all, a budget so late in the year is an affront to fiscal accountability, and a snub to parliamentarians and the Canadians who elected them. The message the government now needs to hear is that a spring budget is still possible, and that it should deliver one.&#xD;
&#xD;
Budgets tell MPs and Canadians how much money the government plans to raise and how the government will raise it. They say how much the government will spend, and how the government will spend it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The federal fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. Governments ideally present budgets in January or February, well before the fiscal year has started. Presenting after the fiscal year has begun means that the government is already raising and spending without proper scrutiny. But presenting a budget while the House of Commons is sitting - prior to June 20 - would be far better than waiting until the fall when the fiscal numbers will be less plan than fait accompli.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is almost half a year since the 2024 fall economic statement. With the new government moving to implement the tax and spending promises from the election campaign and Throne Speech, Parliament and the public need an up-to-date fiscal plan before billions of dollars in new measures are rolled out. &#xD;
&#xD;
Canada's fraught economic situation - chronic low investment and productivity growth, geopolitical risks, and a protracted trade war with the United States - makes a spring budget all the more desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
U.S. fiscal profligacy is pushing interest rates up internationally. An information vacuum that adds to uncertainty about Canadian finances helps no one and will raise alarm among the country's credit rating agencies, which have recently downgraded the scores of two large provinces - Quebec and British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
A late budget would also exacerbate a worrying trend. In the past three decades, the federal government has tabled budgets after the start of the fiscal year only five times. Four of those late budgets appeared since 2015. In 2020, for the first time ever, the federal government failed to produce a budget at all. Defenders of this sidelining of legislative oversight often point out that Parliament must still approve the estimates - the documents that outline a detailed spending plan, which require specific legislative approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the dominance of statutory programs such as seniors' benefits, federal-provincial transfers and interest on Ottawa's growing debt in federal expenses means the estimates cover a relatively small share of the budget. And when the relevant parliamentary committees fail to review their estimates by a May 31 deadline - as happened in the case of 10 committees charged with reviewing $25-billion in federal outlays in 2024 - the estimates are deemed approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
To those who say the recent federal election is an excuse for a late budget, we have a straightforward reply. It is not. If the previous government had taken timeliness more seriously, we would have had a budget before the election.&#xD;
The Ontario government, notwithstanding the same fraught environment and its own election, has produced its 2025 budget. The federal election in 2011 occurred on May 2 and that new government produced a budget on June 6. There is no excuse for delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
A fiscal plan produced in a hurry might even be better. Another adverse trend in recent federal budgets has been bloat: hundreds of pages of self-congratulatory spin, condescending narrative and repetition of previous announcements, which buried the key numbers where only experts could find them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Time pressure could give us something short and to the point: projections for revenues, expenses, the bottom line and the resulting change in the debt right up front, where anyone - including parliamentarians and voters - can find and understand them.&#xD;
&#xD;
The spring window is still open. The government has a chance to correct course for the benefit of Parliament and the public. It should take it.&#xD;

Throne Speech promises largest economic transformation since Second World War&#xD;
Robert Fife, Stephanie Levitz&#xD;
In a ceremony marked by pomp and pageantry, King Charles III opened Parliament on Tuesday, delivering a Throne Speech&#xD;
that affirmed Canada's sovereignty and promised the largest transformation in the Canadian economy since the Second&#xD;
World War.&#xD;
The speech, written by Prime Minister Mark Carney's office in consultation with the King's office, touched on Liberal election&#xD;
promises, including a middle-class tax cut, an end to interprovincial trade barriers, and fast approvals of major infrastructure&#xD;
projects. It framed them as part of a generational opportunity to renew and fortify the country at an uncertain time for the world.&#xD;
The message laced through the Throne Speech was that Canada is an independent country, ready to negotiate a trade and&#xD;
security arrangement with the United States but also determined to forge new trade and defence ties with other partners. The&#xD;
King's presence was widely seen as a signal to U.S. President Donald Trump that Canada is unwilling to abandon its distinct&#xD;
heritage and traditions.&#xD;
The King and Queen Camilla arrived at the Senate, a temporary location housed in a converted railway station, in horse-drawn&#xD;
carriage, accompanied by Governor-General Mary Simon and her husband Whit Fraser. The streets were lined with onlookers&#xD;
keen to get a glimpse of the royal couple, and the crowds several times burst into spontaneous eruptions of God Save the King.&#xD;
Mr. Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, invited the King a few days after he won the Liberal&#xD;
Party leadership, as Mr. Trump was talking of turning the country into the 51st state.&#xD;
In a preamble that was written by the King, the monarch spoke about how each time he visits this country, including this 20th&#xD;
trip, &quot;a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream.&quot;&#xD;
&quot;I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada's unique identity, which is recognized across the world,&quot; King Charles&#xD;
said. He also spoke to the importance of the monarchy to Canadian history. &quot;The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity&#xD;
for Canada.&quot;&#xD;
The King mentioned that when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened Parliament in 1957, it was in the aftermath of the&#xD;
Second World War and in the midst of the Cold War. The world faces a different threat with democratic pluralism, the rule of law&#xD;
and freedom under assault, he said.&#xD;
&quot;The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is&#xD;
changing. Canada's relationships with partners is also changing,&quot; he said.&#xD;
The King acknowledged that &quot;many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around&#xD;
them,&quot; but called on the country to look at the U.S. trade war as an opportunity to think bigger and better.&#xD;
&quot;An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War,&quot; he said. &quot;All&#xD;
Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.&quot; He added that &quot;by&#xD;
staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.&quot;&#xD;
Late Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump repeated his rhetoric about annexing Canada, claiming the country is &quot;considering&quot; the&#xD;
proposition although it has roundly rejected it.&#xD;
In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump held out what he described as the US$61-billion cost of participating in his proposed missile&#xD;
defence system as a reason for Ottawa to agree to annexation.&#xD;
The Prime Minister's Office would not say whether Mr. Trump had delivered this same message or the cost figure to the&#xD;
government directly.&#xD;
It's rare for Canada's monarch to read the Throne Speech. Usually it is read by the governorgeneral. Queen Elizabeth II, the&#xD;
only other reigning monarch to read the speech, did so twice.&#xD;
The King travelled to Canada specifically to deliver it, but also spent Monday touring parts of Ottawa and planting a tree, and&#xD;
later Tuesday laid a wreath at the National War Memorial, before departing back to Britain.&#xD;
He and Camilla sent words of thanks to Canadians for a successful first trip as sovereign.&#xD;
&quot;It was the warmest of welcomes - and the fondest of returns to a land and a people we love,&quot; the King posted to social media.&#xD;
&quot;Until the next time, au revoir, Canada.&quot;&#xD;
Among the many dignitaries invited to attend the opening of Parliament were former prime ministers Justin Trudeau, Stephen&#xD;
Harper and Kim Campbell and former governors-general Adrienne Clarkson, Michaëlle Jean and David Johnston.&#xD;
The speech also reiterated many of the top-line promises from Mr. Carney's election platform, from speeding up housing&#xD;
construction to toughening border security to cracking down on stolen cars and fentanyl trafficking, and boosting Canada's&#xD;
presence in the High Arctic.&#xD;
The government committed Canada to join the ReArm Europe plan, a major defence procurement project to ramp up military&#xD;
arms production in Europe.&#xD;
The move could reduce Canada's reliance on the United States for purchases of military equipment.&#xD;
In an outreach to Indigenous peoples, the Throne Speech also pledged up to $10-billion in loans to enable more&#xD;
communities to become owners of major projects.&#xD;
In a reflection of Mr. Carney's campaign pledge to move swiftly, within hours of the speech, the government tabled a waysandmeans&#xD;
motion to cut personal income tax, the GST on homes and formally end the consumer price on carbon. The motion&#xD;
is a precursor to eventual legislation.&#xD;
The new government, which won a strong minority mandate of 169 seats, also vowed to reduce federal spending.&#xD;
The opposition parties offered tepid reviews of the remarks, with all three parties saying it sent negative signs about what kind&#xD;
of government Mr. Carney will run.&#xD;
Bloc Québécois Leader YvesFrançois Blanchet said to him, the speech set up Mr. Carney as the &quot;CEO of Canada,&quot; with the&#xD;
provinces just as regional offices.&#xD;
&quot;This is not the way it works,&quot; Mr. Blanchet said.&#xD;
Interim NDP leader Don Davies said some elements of the speech sounded like they could have been written by a&#xD;
Conservative government, with its mentions of defence, crime and a focus on natural resource development. There was no&#xD;
discussion of health care, affordable housing or expanding existing programs such as child care or pharmacare, he said.&#xD;
&quot;That's why New Democrats are going to be, I think, such an important voice in Parliament to be pushing for progressive&#xD;
policies,&quot; he said.&#xD;
Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told reporters he'd have written a different speech, one that laid out far more specifics.&#xD;
&quot;Let's replace the talking points with real plans to get it done,&quot; he said.&#xD;
Mr. Poilievre, whose party was on track to win the recent election until taking on Mr. Trump became the ballot-box question,&#xD;
also acknowledged the meaning of having the King deliver the speech.&#xD;
&quot;I think it's important that the world recognize that we have those ancient traditions, that the Americans recognize that we are&#xD;
an independent and free country, that will make its own decisions.&quot;&#xD;

The Throne Speech shows bold vision – but success requires strong public services&#xD;
Prime Minister Mark Carney has set an ambitious agenda to protect Canada, and we welcome it. His government is facing new and unprecedented challenges: economic uncertainty, global instability, trade disruptions, and threats to Canadian sovereignty. As King Charles III noted in the historic Speech from the Throne, &quot;the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
The scale of the government's ambitions is impressive. From building the strongest economy in the G7 to doubling the rate of home construction, from eliminating internal trade barriers by Canada Day to cutting project approval times from 5 years to 2 – this is the kind of bold leadership Canada needs right now.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ambition without capacity is just talk&#xD;
But here's the reality: you can't deliver on more goals with fewer tools. The Throne Speech promises transformational change while simultaneously pledging to cap the public service and cut operating budgets. This contradiction undermines the government's own agenda.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a stronger, more resilient Canada means investing in the public service to succeed. Our members are the quiet force behind Canada's strength – dedicated professionals who protect the health, safety, and economic security of Canadians by building the systems we all rely on when times get tough.&#xD;
&#xD;
Take the Major Federal Project Office, which will cut approval times in half while &quot;upholding Canada's world-leading environmental standards.&quot; Who will staff these accelerated reviews? Scientists, engineers, policy analysts, and regulatory experts – the very public servants whose numbers the government plans to cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
Public services: Canada's anchor in uncertain times&#xD;
In a volatile world, the public service is Canada’s stabilizer. They are the engine behind our economy, our infrastructure, and our national security. They provide safety nets, protect public health, and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Throne Speech acknowledges that &quot;many Canadians are struggling to get ahead&quot; and promises help through programs like the Canadian Dental Care Plan, Pharmacare, and child care. But these programs don't run themselves – they require skilled public servants to design, deliver, and improve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
You cannot protect Canadians by weakening the institutions they rely on.&#xD;
&#xD;
We've been here before – and we delivered&#xD;
PIPSC members have a long history of stepping up in times of crisis. During COVID-19, our members were:&#xD;
&#xD;
Designing and delivering emergency benefit programs that kept families afloat&#xD;
Working in labs to develop mass COVID testing methods&#xD;
Keeping government systems running so Canadians could access support&#xD;
Training nurses to manage outbreaks and bringing Canadians home from abroad&#xD;
Our expertise didn't just help manage the crisis – it helped lead the recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
This moment is no different. Whether it's implementing the new border security measures outlined in the Speech, supporting the creation of Build Canada Homes, or helping deliver on the promise to remove internal trade barriers, our members will be there.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ready to partner for Canada's success&#xD;
We're not just raising concerns – we're offering partnership. PIPSC members are ready to do their part to deliver on this ambitious agenda, just as we always have.&#xD;
&#xD;
But that requires investment in people and services – not cuts, caps, or constraints. Prime Minister Carney's expanded cabinet shows the government understands the scope of the work ahead. Now they need to ensure the public service has the capacity to match that ambition.&#xD;
&#xD;
We're here for Canada. Built to serve, ready to protect.&#xD;
The question is: will the government give us the tools we need to deliver the Canada they've promised?&#xD;

&#xD;
PROBLEM STATEMENT&#xD;
Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada must successfully complete an open, fair, and transparent competitive procurement process to secure a new contract for Social Media Management Services (SMMS). To prevent any disruption in SMMS for 78 GC institutions, the new contract must be secured by spring-summer 2026. The new contract will ensure that all 78 GC institutions maintain existing SMMS capabilities for their daily communications operations and to meet the information needs of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
The current multi-departmental software-as-a-service contract for the Government of Canada (GC) SMMS ends on March 14, 2027. Initially awarded in 2014 and extended twice, the contract will reach its lifecycle end in 2027 and must be re-competed. There is no possibility to extend the contract further. Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada (ESDC/SC) is the technical and project authority for this contract.&#xD;
&#xD;
By virtue of Order in Council (OiC) P.C. 2014-0349 and the ESDC Act, ESDC/SC is mandated to administer the SMMS that enable GC institutions to manage their official social media (SM) accounts. </documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:CourseOfAction" name="Undergo An RFP Process" id="id-79158ea2b78c40a4acdd1792c2d58157">
      <documentation>This proposal aims to start the procurement activities needed to re-compete the SMMS contract, including posting a request for proposals (RFP).&#xD;
The objective is to give all companies a fair opportunity to provide the SMMS offering and ensure the new contract is awarded in 2026.&#xD;
In going back to market to compete the SMMS contract through a fair, competitive process, ESDC/SC aims to:&#xD;
• maintain SMMS that enable GC departments to publish, schedule, gather analytics, and monitor topics of interest on social media content&#xD;
• support federal institutions in meeting departmental communications objectives and the information needs of Canadians&#xD;
• meet legislative requirements</documentation>

      <documentation>KEY ACTIVITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
Work under the Data Innovation Service Area is comprised of various projects through which CDOB partners with business leads to explore opportunities and address business needs. These projects help the Department achieve better value and improve service to Canadians. &#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing demand for services means we need to increase efficiency. Real life examples include finding $192M in unclaimed benefits by linking information across the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. Through this initiative, ESDC addressed the challenge of children of disabled or deceased CPP contributors being unaware of or facing barriers in accessing the Children’s Benefit. A decade of CPP administrative data was linked to Canada Student Loans administrative data to find and list former beneficiaries who were eligible for continued CPP benefits but were not receiving them. On average 9,700 cases of eligible non-recipients were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
Using natural language processing, the Record of Employment (ROE) AI model helped reduce the workload for the Employment Insurance program by automatically categorizing a portion of simple comments on ROEs. The model helped automatically process over half a million comments, speeding up benefit delivery for Canadians. Similarly, over 350,000 T4 work items for CPP and Old Age Security (OAS) recipients were closed between 2017 and 2021, enabling client service officers to shift their focus to more complex cases. &#xD;
Optical character recognition and intelligent document processing are also being evaluated and deployed to help ESDC programs enhance form processing in the Department. This work is another example of work that is helping reduce wait times and allowing agents to focus on more complex work.&#xD;
&#xD;
These are just a few examples of how work in the data innovation space is propelling ESDC forward. Work under this Service Area is helping us use data in innovative ways that improve our understanding of our clients' needs and how we serve them. At the same time, it helps us better understand and manage the potential and risks of new technologies and methods.</documentation>

      <documentation>The ESDC Data Accountability Framework (DAF) is an evergreen document developed to ensure that ESDC leaders are aware of their accountability with respect to the responsible stewardship and use of data. It is a first step towards ensuring that data responsibilities are communicated and well understood across the Department. The Data Accountability Framework lists specific accountabilities and decision rights for managing data assets across key organizational leadership roles. Defining clear accountabilities within ESDC’s governance structure supports timely decision making and effective data management, as well as assessment and management of key risks and issues. Developed in line with various departmental and Government of Canada policies, legislation, and guidance, it organizes data management accountabilities into 14 distinct categories, including Artificial Intelligence, Data/Information Architecture, and Privacy. The Accountability Framework was endorsed by the ESDC Enterprise Management Committee on October 19, 2023.</documentation>

      <documentation>ESDC is also modernizing its current data sharing practices by developing an enterprise-wide data and information sharing framework. The framework is being developed through collaboration with ESDC branches, all levels of government and Indigenous partners. Current data and information sharing practices between ESDC and its partners could be more efficient and transparent. Better practices would increase ESDC’s ability to deliver client-centred services as departmental and interdepartmental data are incrementally centralized, catalogued and integrated while continuing to respect ‘need to know’ principles, confidentiality protocols, and policy and legislative requirements. This will help to minimize costs and risks while increasing efficiencies. An enterprise information sharing framework will standardize and enhance data sharing across the Government of Canada, with the goal of improving data quality and consistency, strengthening data stewardship, increasing data-driven insights, and embedding collaboration with other government departments as the standard, while adhering to legal requirements.</documentation>

Data Innovation&#xD;
Data provides us the opportunity to ask and answer key questions about our operations:&#xD;
&#xD;
Who are we helping?&#xD;
How are we helping them?&#xD;
Can we improve this process?&#xD;
Did we have the impact we had hoped for?&#xD;
Who are we leaving behind?&#xD;
Data Innovation is what drives us to find answers to these types of questions and many more. It supports Business Optimization and Analytics for Decision Making. Data Innovation is about finding new ways to answer questions, finding answers to questions we have never been able to answer before, and in finding questions that we have never even thought to ask. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Data Innovation is about helping you use Advanced Research Methods, Artificial Intelligence, and Intelligent Automation to learn more about our clients and ourselves. ESDC’s Chief Data Officer Branch can help you understand and use modern Design and Development, as well as Reporting and Analytics Visualization, to make the best choices you can in your role at ESDC.</documentation>

Data Culture and Literacy&#xD;
Gaining insights and finding answers to complex questions is only part of the journey. It’s up to you to use that knowledge wisely. The importance of strong Data Culture and Literacy cannot be overstated as foundational to unlocking the value, and actualizing the potential, of ESDC’s vast data holdings. &#xD;
&#xD;
Culture and Literacy are about empowering employees and executives to better understand and use our collective data to ensure programs and services meet the evolving needs of our clients and Canadians. It’s about providing the tools, training, and resources needed to understand the role data play in your work, as well as how to fully leverage data as an enterprise asset. &#xD;
&#xD;
It starts with Talent and Capacity Building, whether Hiring top tier talent or Upskilling and Reskilling existing employees. It is vital that leaders across government equip their organizations and teams with the talent and tools necessary to manage their data effectively, and to use ESDC’s vast vaults of data to their fullest potential. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Chief Data Office has been creating, leading, and supporting ESDC’s data communities of practice, as well as awareness and engagement campaigns, to ensure a stronger culture of data users. Having strong partnerships through proper Business Relationship Management across ESDC ensures we can get the right data into the right hands to make the right choices. </documentation>

Data Governance and Trust&#xD;
An important part of data as a Team Effort is ensuring a common understanding of the various roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities that come with the management of any enterprise asset (such as with HR or Finance). It requires proper Governance and Trust to guide the process of getting the right data into the right hands to make the right decision, while maintaining the confidentiality, security, and privacy of personal information.&#xD;

      <documentation>Employment Equity and Diversity&#xD;
&#xD;
Description: The records containing the information described in this bank include personal information on employees such as education, work history and career aspirations, and training and development, which is collected by means of questionnaires and/or interviews or compiled from employees’ files or automated data systems. The information is collected on a voluntary basis, and respondents are asked to identify whether they are male or female, whether they are an aboriginal person, and whether they have a disability or are a member of a visible minority group. The Personal Record Identifier may be used to identify employees in instances where government institutions are not able to employ an anonymous questionnaire, as well as when these identifiers are required to locate employee records.&#xD;
&#xD;
Class of Individuals: Employees of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose: Related records provide documentation for the implementation of the employment equity policy in government institutions. Data are collected to provide a comprehensive picture of employees by sex and by target group status (e.g., women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minority groups). This information is used to compile a personnel profile of employees and to compare the situation of target group members with non-target group members within a government institution and with their counterparts in the general labour market. The Personal Record Identifier (PRI) may be used to link information in this bank with that in another bank containing employee information (e.g., the Personnel Management Information System) in order to obtain statistical information, where the securing of such information would be consistent with the uses for which the personal information was collected. Self-identification information may be obtained from the institutional records as described in the Standard Personal Information Bank Staffing - PSE 902 (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/standard-personal-information-banks.html#pse902).&#xD;
&#xD;
Consistent Uses: The government institution may collect data for statistical purposes, for purposes relating to individuals, or for both. Personal data are released to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for statistical purposes only (refer to Central Personal Information Bank Employment Equity Data Bank - TBS PCE 739 (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/atipo-baiprp/sfg-srg/sfg-srg02-eng.asp)). The information gathered will be used for institutional purposes in the government’s employment equity program to identify and eliminate systemic discrimination in employment and to introduce temporary special measures to ensure that target groups participate in and are equitably represented in the federal public service. It may also be used for policy and planning purposes related to employment equity.&#xD;

The files are separated based on rules configured within a properties file. If a filename matches a rule, the file is moved to the destination directory specified. If the filename does not match a rule, the file is left in the input directory.&#xD;
Files can be renamed when they are moved to the destination.&#xD;

      <documentation>Crunch/Decrunch&#xD;
The Crunch/Decrunch Facility is a utility for the Windows operating system to permit clients to gather a large number of small files into one file to send through the MSFT Service as one file transfer, instead of a multitude of small file transfers. The sending client runs Crunch and the receiving client runs Decrunch.&#xD;

If RWS ID is not federated to the client’s identity provider, multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be implemented on a per-domain basis. MFA is an authentication method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (factors) to an authentication mechanism:&#xD;

      <documentation>User permissions&#xD;
In RWS Language Cloud, each user belongs to one or more user groups. Each group has a limited set of permissions (a ‘role’) that determines which actions members of the group can execute, and at which level of the organizational structure. The permissions for users who are members of multiple groups are determined by creating a superset of all the&#xD;
permissions of those groups. All users and groups are managed by account administrators. If clients are using a managed service, these administrators would be RWS personnel who set up the users and groups, but do not subsequently have access to the client data. Clients who want to administer their own accounts can do so without any involvement from&#xD;
RWS.&#xD;

      <documentation>Encryption at rest&#xD;
All data that is resident in the application is encrypted at rest. If projects are downloaded for offline translation, those files are not then guaranteed to be encrypted as they reside on a user’s own system. To mitigate this issue, there is a feature to force users to work online, which will prevent the data from leaving the application server. With this feature enabled on a project, translators and reviewers will only be able to use the browser-based interface.</documentation>

Description (Purpose of business)    &#xD;
The on-going need to modify a large number of existing correspondence systems to meet changing business requirements, along with the desire to discontinue the creation of custom applications for each business line, ESDC’s Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) seeks to implement an enterprise-wide correspondence solution to allow Service Canada and ESDC to receive and disseminate data through multiple and varied channels - print (mail), fax, email, SMS (text) or Web (html).&#xD;
&#xD;
This solution would allow flexibility to meet both internal and external needs quickly and to manage correspondence based on business needs, as well as decouple the systems integration needs from business processes and rules.  Therefore as business rules change the entire system does not have to change, rather one system process.  This would allow for the implementation of a solution that can be reused by all business lines as well as easily adjustable to future system and business changes.&#xD;

      <documentation>2.2	Problem/Opportunity&#xD;
The CSLP has been unable to resolve certain account access issues affecting users of its National Student Loan Services Centre (NSLSC) portal since the program on boarded to the credentials and ECAS in April 2018. There are three main problems facing its clients: &#xD;
•	At least 30,000 NSLSC accounts are now locked out, and that number increases each day. The causes for this include:&#xD;
o	GCKey username and password credentials are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful NSLSC login and contributing to the increasing tally of account lockouts.&#xD;
o	NSLSC security questions and answers are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful credential substitution, and sustaining the account lockout tally.&#xD;
•	MSFAA (Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement) for identity verification, as enabled by the Finastra vendor, is constrained to a single-use activation. NSLSC requires consuming one activation upon initial registration of the student. &#xD;
&#xD;
Note: Although CSLP has determined this to be the root cause for the business problems defined in this requirements document, it is not feasible to change the Finastra solution; therefore, the corrective action must start with the ECAS product. &#xD;
•	PAC method (i.e., re-registering the NSLSC account using credential substitution) for identity verification is a capability currently unavailable to NSLSC. &#xD;
&#xD;
Note: The program (CSLP) is in the process of evaluating the use of PAC as an alternative identity validation channel. &#xD;
The consequences of these account access issues include:&#xD;
•	Negatively affected CSLP reputation (due to limitations of IT-enabled services).&#xD;
•	Inability of clients (i.e., students) to access student loan status, balance, services, etc.&#xD;
•	Increased call volume managed by the R&amp;A and CSLP (NSLSC support) to manage these issues.&#xD;
In response to these challenges, this SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative seeks to: &#xD;
Augment the ECAS component by integrating SDIV with the capability to substitute credentials on NSLSC accounts, which will enable affected students to unlock their accounts. &#xD;
The integration of SDIV as a service to CSLP in the NSLSC product would provide an alternate identity verification provider to support client credential substitution for the following scenario:&#xD;
-	NSLSC account login credentials and/or security Q&amp;A’s are forgotten by the client user.&#xD;
SDIV integrated within NSLSC (SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative) is consistent with BDM and ESDC transformational business needs in addition to addressing current operational needs with respect to regaining access to locked client accounts. Additionally, providing a rapid identity verification experience to users seeking to substitute their credentials. The SDIV-MVP2 CSLP solution will support service transformation across ESDC by providing a high-quality service experience which enables clients to access loan information and other services in a more timely and accessible manner.&#xD;
As a result, ESDC must assess new and adaptive technologies that will allow CLSP to provide a feasible alternative to the identity verification option to all students who wish to re-register and access their NSLSC account.</documentation>

&#xD;
Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, the Government has mandated vaccination for federal and federally-regulated workers, and for everyone travelling within Canada by plane, train, or ship. It has also ensured a standardized Canadian proof of vaccination for domestic and international use.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is securing next generation COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and doses for kids from 5 to 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
And around the world, Canada will continue working with its partners to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines and other resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build a healthy future, we must also strengthen our healthcare system and public health supports for all Canadians, especially seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities, and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is work to be done. On accessibility. On care in rural communities. On delayed procedures. On mental health and addiction treatment. On long-term care. On improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions and get the best possible results.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will work collaboratively with provinces, territories, and other partners to deliver real results on what Canadians need.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="This Is The Moment To Grow A More Resilient Economy" id="id-e1b0d12666eb4fe0b72c02c288970418">
      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GROW A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY&#xD;
&#xD;
The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good. But as we do, we should rebuild an economy that works for everyone. At the height of the lockdowns, the Government made historic, necessary investments so families could keep paying the rent and small businesses could stay afloat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, with one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, and employment back to pre-pandemic levels, the Government is moving to more targeted support, while&#xD;
prudently managing spending. &#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure no one is left behind, support will be extended or added for industries that continue to struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also continue making life more affordable for all Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inflation is a challenge that countries around the world are facing. And while Canada’s economic performance is better than many of our partners, we must keep tackling the rising cost of living. To do that, the Government’s plan includes two major priorities: housing and child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whether it is building more units per year, increasing affordable housing, or ending chronic homelessness, the Government is committed to working with its partners to get real results.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, the Housing Accelerator Fund will help municipalities build more and better, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also help families buy their first home sooner with a more flexible First-Time Home Buyer’s Incentive, a new Rent-to-Own program, and by reducing the closing costs for first-time buyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting families will make life more affordable for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Canada Child Benefit has already helped lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and will continue increasing to keep up with the cost of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue building the first-ever Canada-wide early learning and child care system. By the end of 2022, average fees for regulated child care will be cut in half in most of the provinces and territories. And in some places, this will even happen as early as the start of the year. Families will save thousands of dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four jurisdictions have not yet reached agreements on child care. Two are territories with unique infrastructure challenges, and the Government will keep working together to ensure we meet the needs of the North. The Government will continue working with the remaining two provinces to finalize agreements that will deliver $10-a-day child care for families who so badly need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in affordable child care – just like housing – is not just good for families. It helps grow the entire economy. And so does immigration.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will continue increasing immigration levels and reducing wait times, while supporting family reunification and delivering a world-leading refugee resettlement program.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="This Is The Moment For Bolder Climate Action" id="id-d24f0854442d42a3a0472f6ec77c7204">
      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT FOR BOLDER CLIMATE ACTION&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries – we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world’s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians’ pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada’s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Protecting Canadians From COVID-19" id="id-64dc6befe30f452f95795a6dcbb4110b">
      <documentation>The first foundation of the Government’s approach is protecting Canadians from COVID-19.&#xD;
This is priority number one.&#xD;
It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.&#xD;
Over the last six months, Canadians have stood united and strong. Their actions embody what has always been the purpose of the federal government: bringing Canadians together to achieve common goals.&#xD;
Personal protective equipment has been shipped across the country. Members of the Canadian Forces were there in long-term care homes. Close to 9 million Canadians were helped with the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and over 3.5 million jobs were supported by the wage subsidy.&#xD;
The Government will continue to have people’s backs just like Canadians have each other’s backs.&#xD;
Through the first wave, contact tracing and testing ramped up across the country. The surge this fall further reinforces what we already know – that we must do even more.&#xD;
The federal government will be there to help the provinces increase their testing capacity. Canadians should not be waiting in line for hours to get a test.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government is pursuing every technology and every option for faster tests for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. As soon as tests are approved for safe use in Canada, the Government will do everything it can to see them deployed. The Government will also create a federal Testing Assistance Response Team to quickly meet surge testing needs, including in remote and isolated communities.&#xD;
Local public health authorities are the backbone of our nation’s efforts to stop outbreaks before they start. As members of the communities they protect, they know the devastating economic impact a lockdown order can have.&#xD;
To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders. To make that decision easier for the public health authorities, and to help ease the impact that science- and evidence-based decisions can have on local businesses in the short term, the Government will work to target additional financial support directly to businesses which have to temporarily shut down as a result of a local public health decision.&#xD;
This will ensure that decisions are made with the health of Canadians as the first priority.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on what communities need more broadly.&#xD;
The Government has already invested over $19 billion for a Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and territories, to support everything from the capacity of health care systems to securing PPE.&#xD;
To address the challenges faced by provinces and territories as they reopen classrooms, the federal government invested $2 billion in the Safe Return to Class Fund, along with new funding for First Nations communities. This is money to keep kids – and staff – safe in the classroom, whether that’s by helping schools buy cleaning supplies or upgrade ventilation.&#xD;
These commitments build on federal investments to support people who are most at risk and those who care for them, including with the federal wage top-up for personal support workers. People on the frontlines who have been looking after seniors do vital work and the Government will continue to have their backs.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will continue to support Canadians as they take action to keep each other safe.&#xD;
Already, people are doing their part by wearing masks. That’s important, and we can build on that commitment. Working with private sector partners, the federal government created the COVID Alert app. Canadians living in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan now have an extra tool to keep themselves and others safe. The Government hopes all the others will sign on so that people in all parts of the country can both do their part and be better protected.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to work on getting Canadians the PPE they need.&#xD;
This spring, the Government issued a call, and thousands of Canadian businesses and manufacturers responded. From shop floors to companies big and small, Canada’s dynamic businesses met the challenge as their workers stepped up. &#xD;
And in less than six months, Canadians are now manufacturing almost all types of PPE. The Government will continue building that domestic capacity, while securing supply chains to keep Canadians safe and create jobs.&#xD;
Canadians are pulling together, whether that’s with PPE manufacturing, through the COVID Alert app, or by wearing a mask. In the same way, Canadian researchers and scientists are pitching in to the Team Canada effort with their knowledge and expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
VACCINE EFFORTS&#xD;
In the long run, the best way to end this pandemic is with a safe and effective vaccine.&#xD;
Canada’s vaccine strategy is all about ensuring that Canadians will be able to get a vaccine once it is ready.&#xD;
There are many types of potential candidates. Canada is exploring the full range of options. The Government has already secured access to vaccine candidates and therapeutics, while investing in manufacturing here at home. And to get the vaccines out to Canadians once they’re ready, the Government has made further investments in our capacity for vaccine distribution.&#xD;
From the Vaccine Task Force that provides the best advice on vaccine purchasing and roll-out, to the Immunity Task Force looking at how COVID-19 is affecting vulnerable populations, Canada’s top scientific minds are guiding the Government every step of the way.</documentation>
    </element>
    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Helping Canadians Through The Pandemic" id="id-ef9a965abc7f46d099cac14fffc40925">
      <documentation>The medical and scientific fight against this virus is crucial. And so are the livelihoods of every single Canadian, worker, and family.&#xD;
So the second foundation of the Government’s approach is supporting Canadians through this crisis.&#xD;
The economic impact of COVID-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be short-lived.&#xD;
This is not the time for austerity. Canada entered this crisis in the best fiscal position of its peers. And the Government is using that fiscal firepower, on things like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, so that Canadians, businesses, and our entire economy have the support needed to weather the storm.&#xD;
Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
CREATING JOBS&#xD;
People losing their jobs is perhaps the clearest consequence of the global economic shock that Canadians – like those in other countries – have faced.&#xD;
The CERB helped people stay healthy at home while being able to keep food on the table.&#xD;
The CEWS helped people keep their jobs, or be rehired if they had been laid off.&#xD;
But there is still more to be done.&#xD;
Unemployment is in the double digits, and underemployment is high.&#xD;
Women, racialized Canadians, and young people have borne the brunt of job losses.&#xD;
Canadians need good jobs they can rely on.&#xD;
To help make that happen, the Government will launch a campaign to create over one million jobs, restoring employment to previous levels. This will be done by using a range of tools, including direct investments in the social sector and infrastructure, immediate training to quickly skill up workers, and incentives for employers to hire and retain workers.&#xD;
One way the Government will create these jobs is by extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy right through to next summer. The Government will work with businesses and labour to ensure the program meets the needs of the health and economic situation as it evolves.&#xD;
Another example of how the Government will create jobs is by significantly scaling up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, to provide more paid work experiences next year for young Canadians.&#xD;
Now, more than ever, Canadians must work together – including by eliminating remaining barriers between provinces to full, free internal trade – to get the economy back up and running and Canadians back to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES&#xD;
With the job losses that Canadians have faced, it became clear early on that many people would need help until they could find work once again. But existing income support systems were not designed to handle this unprecedented situation. That’s why the Government moved quickly to create the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as a temporary program to help millions of Canadians get through a very difficult time.&#xD;
With the economic restart now well underway, CERB recipients should instead be supported by the Employment Insurance system. For people who would not traditionally qualify for EI, the Government will create the transitional Canada Recovery Benefit.&#xD;
Over the coming months, the EI system will become the sole delivery mechanism for employment benefits, including for Canadians who did not qualify for EI before the pandemic. This pandemic has shown that Canada needs an EI system for the 21st century, including for the self-employed and those in the gig economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
WOMEN IN THE ECONOMY&#xD;
Women – and in particular low-income women – have been hit hardest by COVID-19. This crisis has been described as a She-cession.&#xD;
Many women have bravely served on the frontlines of this crisis, in our communities or by shouldering the burden of unpaid care work at home.&#xD;
We must not let the legacy of the pandemic be one of rolling back the clock on women’s participation in the workforce, nor one of backtracking on the social and political gains women and allies have fought so hard to secure.&#xD;
The Government will create an Action Plan for Women in the Economy to help more women get back into the workforce and to ensure a feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery. This Plan will be guided by a task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole of government approach.&#xD;
It has been nearly 50 years since the Royal Commission on the Status of Women outlined the necessity of child care services for women’s social and economic equality. We have long understood that Canada cannot succeed if half of the population is held back. Canadians need more accessible, affordable, inclusive, and high quality childcare.&#xD;
Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the Government will make a significant, long-term, sustained investment to create a Canada-wide early learning and childcare system.&#xD;
The Government will build on previous investments, learn from the model that already exists in Quebec, and work with all provinces and territories to ensure that high-quality care is accessible to all.&#xD;
There is broad consensus from all parts of society, including business and labour leaders, that the time is now.&#xD;
The Government also remains committed to subsidizing before- and after-school program costs. With the way that this pandemic has affected parents and families, flexible care options for primary school children are more important than ever.&#xD;
The Government will also accelerate the Women’s Entrepreneurship Strategy, which has already helped women across Canada grow their businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES&#xD;
As the Government invests in people, it will continue to support job-creating businesses.&#xD;
Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities and the backbone of the economy. The Government introduced a range of supports for Canadian businesses, from help with payroll through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to assistance with expenses through interest-free loans.&#xD;
COVID-19 has caused businesses across the country, both large and small, to rethink their approaches. Entrepreneurs and owners are looking at more digital options, more creative solutions, and more climate-friendly investments.&#xD;
The Government will help businesses adapt for the future and thrive.&#xD;
This fall, in addition to extending the wage subsidy, the Government will take further steps to bridge vulnerable businesses to the other side of the pandemic by:&#xD;
• Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account to help businesseswith fixed costs;&#xD;
• Improving the Business Credit Availability Program;&#xD;
• And introducing further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel and tourism, hospitality, and cultural industries like the performing arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY&#xD;
This COVID-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the Government had done less.&#xD;
With interest rates so low, central banks can only do so much to help. There is a global consensus that governments must do more. Government can do so while also locking in the low cost of borrowing for decades to come. This Government will preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage and continue to be guided by values of sustainability and prudence.&#xD;
There are two distinct needs. The first is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes, using whatever fiscal firepower is needed to support people and businesses during the pandemic. The best way to keep the economy strong is to keep Canadians healthy.&#xD;
The second need is to build back better, with a sustainable approach for future generations. As the Government builds a plan for stimulus and recovery, this must be done responsibly.&#xD;
In the longer term, the Government will focus on targeted investments to strengthen the middle class, build resiliency, and generate growth. The Government will also identify additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality, including by concluding work to limit the stock option deduction for wealthy individuals at large, established corporations, and addressing corporate tax avoidance by digital giants.&#xD;
Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change, and will change. The Government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media, and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music, and in writing.&#xD;
This fall, the Government will release an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out new measures to implement this Throne Speech.&#xD;
This update will make clear that the strength of the middle class, and the wellbeing of all Canadians, remain Canada’s key measures of success.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building Back Better: A Resilience Agenda For the Middle Class" id="id-a945092bd2314a8b971cf22528bfe499">
      <documentation>As we fight for every Canadian and defend everyone’s ability to succeed, we also need to focus on the future, and on building back better. This forms the third foundation of the Government’s approach.&#xD;
Around the world, advanced economies are realizing that things should not go back to business as usual. COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerabilities in our societies.&#xD;
The Government will create a resiliency agenda for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
This will include addressing the gaps in our social systems, investing in health care, and creating jobs. It will also include fighting climate change, and maintaining a commitment to fiscal sustainability and economic growth as the foundation of a strong and vibrant society.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING GAPS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS&#xD;
Central to this is recognizing that one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is the lives lost in long-term care homes. Elders deserve to be safe, respected, and live in dignity.&#xD;
Although long-term care falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government will take any action it can to support seniors while working alongside the provinces and territories.&#xD;
The Government will work with Parliament on Criminal Code amendments to explicitly penalize those who neglect seniors under their care, putting them in danger.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for long-term care so that seniors get the best support possible;&#xD;
• And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to increasing Old Age Security once a senior turns 75, and boosting the Canada Pension Plan survivor’s benefit.&#xD;
The Government will look at further targeted measures for personal support workers, who do an essential service helping the most vulnerable in our communities. Canada must better value their work and their contributions to our society.&#xD;
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities, and highlighted long-standing challenges. The Government will bring forward a Disability Inclusion Plan, which will have:&#xD;
• A new Canadian Disability Benefit modelled after the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors;&#xD;
• A robust employment strategy for Canadians with disabilities;&#xD;
• And a better process to determine eligibility for Government disability programs and benefits.&#xD;
Over the last six months, it has become clearer than ever why Canadians need a resilient health care system.&#xD;
The Government will ensure that everyone – including in rural and remote areas – has access to a family doctor or primary care team. COVID-19 has also shown that our system needs to be more flexible and able to reach people at home. The Government will continue to expand capacity to deliver virtual health care.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to address the opioid epidemic tearing through communities, which is an ongoing and worsening public health crisis. Additionally, the Government will further increase access to mental health resources. All Canadians should have the care they need, when they need it. We will all be stronger for it.&#xD;
The same goes for access to the medicine that keeps people healthy. Many Canadians who had drug plans through work lost this coverage when they were laid off because of the pandemic. So this is exactly the right moment to ramp up efforts to address that.&#xD;
The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:&#xD;
• Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;&#xD;
• Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low; &#xD;
• And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.&#xD;
In addition to good health infrastructure, Canadians also need strong, safe communities to call home.&#xD;
The Government has banned assault-style firearms. The Government will also continue implementing firearms policy commitments, including:&#xD;
• Giving municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns;&#xD;
• And strengthening measures to control the flow of illegal guns into Canada.&#xD;
Women’s safety must be the foundation on which all progress is built. The Government will accelerate investments in shelters and transition housing, and continue to advance with a National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence.&#xD;
To keep building strong communities, over the next two years the Government will also invest in all types of infrastructure, including public transit, energy efficient retrofits, clean energy, rural broadband, and affordable housing, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and northern communities.&#xD;
In the last six months, many more people have worked from home, done classes from the kitchen table, shopped online, and accessed government services remotely. So it has become more important than ever that all Canadians have access to the internet.&#xD;
The Government will accelerate the connectivity timelines and ambitions of the Universal Broadband Fund to ensure that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed internet.&#xD;
And to further link our communities together, the Government will work with partners to support regional routes for airlines. It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services. This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development. The Government will work to support this.&#xD;
Strong communities are places where everyone has a safe, affordable home. No one should be without a place to stay during a pandemic, or for that matter, a Canadian winter.&#xD;
This week, the Government invested more than $1 billion for people experiencing homelessness, including for this fall.&#xD;
In 2017, the Government announced that it would reduce chronic homelessness by 50 percent. The Government has already helped more than a million people get a safe and affordable place to call home. Given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also make substantial investments in housing for Canadians.&#xD;
The Government will add to the historic National Housing Strategy announced in 2017 by increasing investments to rapid housing in the short term, and partnering with not-for-profits and co-ops in the mid- to long-term. For the middle class, the Government will also move forward with enhancements to the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, including in Canada’s largest cities, so families can afford to buy their first home.&#xD;
Housing is something everyone deserves, and it’s also a key driver of the economy. Construction projects create jobs, and having a home is critical so people can contribute to their communities.&#xD;
Just like everyone deserves a home, everyone deserves to be able to put nutritious food on the table.&#xD;
The pandemic has made that harder for Canadians. The Government will continue to work with partners – including directly with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners – to address food insecurity in Canada. The Government will also strengthen local food supply chains here in Canada.&#xD;
The Canadian and migrant workers who produce, harvest, and process our food – from people picking fruit to packing seafood – have done an outstanding job getting good food on people’s plates. They deserve the Government’s full support and protection.&#xD;
The Government will also ensure that those in Canada’s supply managed sectors receive full and fair compensation for recent trade agreements. Farmers keep our families fed, and we will continue to help them succeed and grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
A STRONGER WORKFORCE&#xD;
This pandemic has revealed gaps in health, housing, and food supply. And it has also laid bare inequalities Canadians face in the workforce.&#xD;
We have an opportunity to not just support Canadians, but grow their potential. Working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make the largest investment in Canadian history in training for workers. This will include by:&#xD;
• Supporting Canadians as they build new skills in growing sectors;&#xD;
• Helping workers receive education and accreditation;&#xD;
• And strengthening workers’ futures, by connecting them to employers and good jobs, in order to grow and strengthen the middle class.&#xD;
From researchers developing vaccines, to entrepreneurs building online stores, this pandemic has reminded us of the power of the knowledge economy, and how vital it is for our future.&#xD;
Canadians are leading, and they should have government services that keep up.&#xD;
The Government will make generational investments in updating outdated IT systems to modernize the way that Government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, from people looking for work to those living with a disability.&#xD;
The Government will also work to introduce free, automatic tax filing for simple returns to ensure citizens receive the benefits they need.&#xD;
Government must remain agile, and ready for what lies ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKING ACTION ON EXTREME RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE&#xD;
Climate action will be a cornerstone of our plan to support and create a millionjobs across the country.&#xD;
This is where the world is going. Global consumers and investors are demanding and rewarding climate action.&#xD;
Canadians have the determination and ingenuity to rise to this challenge and global market opportunity.&#xD;
We can create good jobs today and a globally competitive economy not just next year, but in 2030, 2040, and beyond.&#xD;
Canadians also know climate change threatens our health, way of life, and planet. They want climate action now, and that is what the Government will continue to deliver.&#xD;
The Government will immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal. The Government will also legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.&#xD;
As part of its plan, the Government will:&#xD;
• Create thousands of jobs retrofitting homes and buildings, cutting energy costs for Canadian families and businesses;&#xD;
• Invest in reducing the impact of climate-related disasters, like floods and wildfires, to make communities safer and more resilient;&#xD;
• Help deliver more transit and active transit options;&#xD;
• And make zero-emissions vehicles more affordable while investing in more charging stations across the country.&#xD;
A good example of adapting to a carbon-neutral future is building zero-emissions vehicles and batteries. Canada has the resources – from nickel to copper – needed for these clean technologies. This – combined with Canadian expertise – is Canada’s competitive edge.&#xD;
The Government will launch a new fund to attract investments in making zero-emissions products and cut the corporate tax rate in half for these companies to create jobs and make Canada a world leader in clean technology. The Government will ensure Canada is the most competitive jurisdiction in the world for clean technology companies.&#xD;
Additionally, the Government will:&#xD;
• Transform how we power our economy and communities by moving forward with the Clean Power Fund, including with projects like the Atlantic Loop that will connect surplus clean power to regions transitioning away from coal;&#xD;
• And support investments in renewable energy and next-generation clean energy and technology solutions.&#xD;
Canada cannot reach net zero without the know-how of the energy sector, and the innovative ideas of all Canadians, including people in places like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Support manufacturing, natural resource, and energy sectors as they work to transform to meet a net zero future, creating good-paying and long-lasting jobs;&#xD;
• And recognize farmers, foresters, and ranchers as key partners in the fight against climate change, supporting their efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.&#xD;
The Government will continue its policy of putting a price on pollution, while putting that money back in the pockets of Canadians. It cannot be free to pollute.&#xD;
This pandemic has reminded Canadians of the importance of nature. The Government will work with municipalities as part of a new commitment to expand urban parks, so that everyone has access to green space. This will be done while protecting a quarter of Canada’s land and a quarter of Canada’s oceans in five years, and using nature-based solutions to fight climate change, including by planting two billion trees.&#xD;
The Government will ban harmful single-use plastics next year and ensure more plastic is recycled. And the Government will also modernize Canada’s Environmental Protection Act.&#xD;
When the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was closed by a previous government, Canada lost an important tool to manage its waters. The Government will create a new Canada Water Agency to keep our water safe, clean, and well-managed. The Government will also identify opportunities to build more resilient water and irrigation infrastructure.&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will look at continuing to grow Canada’s ocean economy to create opportunities for fishers and coastal communities, while advancing reconciliation and conservation objectives. Investing in the Blue Economy will help Canada prosper.&#xD;

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="The Canada We're Fighting For" id="id-4b02b85af04544bd8260918914e22510">
      <documentation>This is a fight for Canadians today and Canada tomorrow. So we must never forget the values that make us who we are. The fourth and final foundation of the Government’s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.&#xD;
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.&#xD;
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that’s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.&#xD;
&#xD;
RECONCILIATION&#xD;
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.&#xD;
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.&#xD;
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:&#xD;
• Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;&#xD;
• Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action;&#xD;
• And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation to accelerate the government’s 10-year commitment.&#xD;
The Government will also:&#xD;
• Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;&#xD;
• And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the Métis Nation.&#xD;
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM&#xD;
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.&#xD;
Many people – especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians – have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.&#xD;
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.&#xD;
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.&#xD;
The Government will redouble its efforts by:&#xD;
• Taking action on online hate;&#xD;
• Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;&#xD;
• Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;&#xD;
• Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;&#xD;
• And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.&#xD;
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are&#xD;
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.&#xD;
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.&#xD;
The Government will:&#xD;
• Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;&#xD;
• Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;&#xD;
• Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;&#xD;
• Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;&#xD;
• And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.&#xD;
&#xD;
PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES&#xD;
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.&#xD;
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.&#xD;
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.&#xD;
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WELCOMING CANADA&#xD;
Immigration remains a driver of Canada’s economic growth.&#xD;
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world’s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.&#xD;
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.&#xD;
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.&#xD;
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
CANADA IN THE WORLD&#xD;
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada’s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.&#xD;
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.&#xD;
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.&#xD;
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.&#xD;
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government’s plan does that as well.</documentation>

While we address climate change –&#xD;
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences –&#xD;
While we grow our economy for everyone –&#xD;
We cannot turn away from other challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.&#xD;
&#xD;
During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone should be – and feel – safe.&#xD;

      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO STAND UP FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians understand that equity, justice, and diversity are the means and the ends to living together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fighting systemic racism, sexism, discrimination, misconduct, and abuse, including in our core institutions, will remain a key priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue to reform the criminal justice system and policing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to rebuild for everyone. The Government will continue to invest in the empowerment of Black and racialized Canadians, and Indigenous Peoples. It will also continue to fight harmful content online, and stand up for LGBTQ2 communities while completing the ban on conversion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Canadians, our two official languages are part of who we are.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is essential to support official language minority communities, and to protect and promote French outside and inside Quebec.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will reintroduce the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English and the Strengthening of the Official Languages Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support Canadian culture and creative industries, the Government will also reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act and ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.</documentation>

      <documentation>THIS IS THE MOMENT TO MOVE FASTER ON THE PATH OF RECONCILIATION&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth. As the Government continues to respond to the Calls to Action, it will invest in that truth, including with the creation of a national monument to honour survivors, and with the appointment of a Special Interlocutor to further advance justice on residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support communities, the Government will also invest significantly in a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy, guided by Indigenous Peoples, survivors, and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone in our country deserves to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will accelerate work with Indigenous partners to address the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also make sure communities have the support they need to keep families together, while ensuring fair and equitable compensation for those harmed by the First Nations Child and Family Services program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Reconciliation requires a whole-of-government approach, breaking down barriers, and rethinking how to accelerate our work. Whether it is eliminating all remaining long-term drinking water advisories or implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Government is committed to closing the gaps that far too many First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities still face today.</documentation>

      <documentation>https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2021/12/16/minister-employment-workforce-development-and-disability-inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Minister Qualtrough:&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for continuing to serve Canadians as Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, your immediate priority is to support workers whose work has been interrupted by public health measures. I also expect you to build a better, more inclusive employment insurance system, complete and advance early and significant actions under Canada’s Disability Inclusion Action Plan, and help workers and communities prosper as we move to net-zero, including through the launch of a Clean Jobs Training Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;

As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.&#xD;

&#xD;
Dear Minister Gould:&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for agreeing to serve Canadians as Minister of Families, Children and Social Development.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, your immediate priority is to build a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system that reduces parent fees, creates more high-quality spaces, recruits and retains skilled educators, and ensures all kids get off to the best possible start. At the same time, you will work with Indigenous partners to implement a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system. You will also focus on implementing the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as well as ensure Service Canada provides reliable and accessible services to Canadians, regardless of where they live. &#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supported by the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, continue advancing the creation and sustainability of a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system, including:&#xD;
Concluding negotiations with remaining provinces and territories and implementing agreements:&#xD;

Reducing regulated child care fees to $10 a day on average by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026 everywhere outside of Quebec, and&#xD;
Building 250,000 new high-quality child care spaces and hiring 40,000 more early childhood educators by the end of fiscal year 2025-2026;&#xD;
Introducing federal child care legislation to strengthen and protect a high-quality Canada-wide child care system; &#xD;
Establishing a National Advisory Council on Early Learning and Child Care;&#xD;
Continuing to advance work with provinces and territories to reduce fees for families for before and after school care; and&#xD;
Ensuring the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care is fully resourced and operational by early 2023.&#xD;
Work with Indigenous partners to ensure that Indigenous children have access to a culturally appropriate Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care system that meets the needs of Indigenous families wherever they live, including ensuring more Indigenous families have access to high-quality programming, creating 3,300 new child care spaces, and continuing to support before and after school care for First Nations children on reserve.&#xD;
Advance the implementation of the Community Services Recovery Fund to help charities and non-profits adapt and modernize as they recover from the pandemic.&#xD;
Continue advancing the Social Innovation and Social Finance strategy, including fully implementing the Social Finance Fund and launching the Social Innovation Advisory Council.&#xD;
Through the delivery of Canada’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and other measures, continue leading implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and with provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous partners and stakeholders to develop a National School Food Policy and to work toward a national school nutritious meal program.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Seniors to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.&#xD;
As the Minister responsible for Service Canada, lead the development and implementation of modern, resilient, secure and reliable services and benefit delivery systems for Canadians and ensure those services and benefits reach all Canadians regardless of where they live.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of National Revenue toward the implementation of a real-time e-payroll system, and ensure that businesses of all sizes benefit from this work.&#xD;
Enhance the capacity and effectiveness of Black-led and Black-serving organizations through the continued implementation of the Supporting Black Canadian Communities Initiative. You will be supported in this work by the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion.&#xD;
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure the voices and needs of children are represented in our Government’s agenda, as we work to make Canada the best place to grow up.&#xD;
Work with the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as they recover from the impact of the pandemic.&#xD;
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making.

As Minister of Labour, your immediate priorities are to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccinations are enforced for those workers and to advance amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 paid days of sick leave for all federally regulated workers. I also expect you to work with federally regulated employers and labour groups, and with provincial and territorial counterparts, to make workplaces fairer and safer for everyone across the country as well as lead our efforts to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continue to work with federally regulated workplaces to ensure that COVID-19 vaccination is enforced.&#xD;
Secure passage of amendments to the Canada Labour Code to provide 10 days of paid sick leave for all federally regulated workers, and convene provinces and territories to develop a national action plan to legislate sick leave across the country while respecting provincial-territorial jurisdiction and the unique needs of small business owners.&#xD;

To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by Cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Minister of Seniors, your immediate priority is to support and help advance the Government’s commitment to increase Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. I also expect you to support the Minister of Health in improving the quality and availability of long-term care and to take concrete actions to support seniors who want to age at home. As well, you will continue to create opportunities for seniors to be more connected, supported, and active members of their communities through implementing the New Horizons for Seniors Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building on our commitment to old age security, increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement by $500 for single seniors and $750 for couples starting at age 65.&#xD;
Ensure seniors’ eligibility for the Guaranteed Income Supplement is not negatively impacted by receipt of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB).&#xD;
Establish an expert panel to provide recommendations for establishing an Aging at Home Benefit. You will be supported by the Minister of Health in this work.&#xD;
Assist community-based organizations in providing practical support that helps low-income and otherwise vulnerable seniors age in place, and support regional and national projects that help expand services that have already demonstrated results in helping seniors stay in their homes.&#xD;
Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development to provide seniors with a single point of access to a wide range of government services and benefits.&#xD;
Continue to work with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to strengthen Canada’s approach to elder abuse by finalizing the national definition of elder abuse, investing in better data collection and establishing new offences and penalties in the Criminal Code related to elder abuse.&#xD;
Represent the Government of Canada at the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Seniors Forum.&#xD;
Continue leading work within Employment and Social Development Canada on seniors’ programming including the New Horizons for Seniors Program.&#xD;
Support the Minister of Health in their work to improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes and beds. This includes working with provinces and territories to improve infection prevention and control measures, identify shared principles, and develop national standards to ensure seniors get the care they deserve.&#xD;
As Minister, you are also responsible for actively engaging with your Cabinet and Caucus colleagues. As we deliver on our platform commitments, it will be important that members of the Ministry continue to collaborate and work constructively to support rigorous and productive Cabinet decision-making. I expect you to support your colleagues in delivering their commitments, leveraging the expertise of your department and your own lived experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
To best achieve results for Canadians, Ministers must be rigorous and coordinated in our approach to implementation. I would therefore ask that you return to me with a proposed approach for the delivery of your mandate commitments, including priorities for early implementation. Furthermore, to ensure we are accountable for our work, I will be asking you to publicly report to me, and all Canadians, on your progress toward these commitments on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we have been reminded throughout the pandemic, adapting to change is not only something government should do, it is something government must do. As you work to fulfil our commitments, I expect you to actively consider new ideas and issues as they emerge, whether through public engagement, your work with Parliamentarians or advice from the public service. I also expect you to work with your Deputy Minister to assess priorities on a continual basis as we build a better future for all Canadians. In addition to achieving results, you are responsible for overseeing the work of your department and ensuring the effective operation of your portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you staff your office and implement outreach and recruitment strategies for federally appointed leadership positions and boards, I ask that you uphold the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. This helps ensure that federal workplaces are dynamic and reflective of the Canadians we serve. You will also ensure your Minister’s office and portfolio are reflective of our commitment to healthy and safe workplaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes – as we all will – Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
I know I can count on you to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted in you, and to turn to me, and the Deputy Prime Minister, early and often to support you in your role as Minister.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely,&#xD;
&#xD;

      <documentation>https://pm.gc.ca/fr/lettres-de-mandat/2021/12/16/lettre-de-mandat-de-la-ministre-de-lemploi-du-developpement-de-la-main&#xD;
&#xD;
Madame la Ministre,&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous remercie de continuer de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.&#xD;
&#xD;
En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.&#xD;
&#xD;
La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tant que ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir les travailleurs dont le travail a été interrompu par des mesures de santé publique. Je m’attends à ce que vous mettiez en place un meilleur système d’assurance-emploi qui soit plus inclusif, à ce que vous meniez à bien et fassiez progresser les premières mesures importantes prévues dans le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, et à ce que vous aidiez les travailleurs et les collectivités à prospérer au moment où nous passons à la carboneutralité, notamment par le lancement d’un centre de formation pour les emplois propres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Travailler à l’adoption et à la mise en œuvre d’une nouvelle Prestation canadienne pour les travailleurs en cas de confinement pour soutenir les travailleurs touchés par une interruption de travail découlant des mesures de santé publique.&#xD;
Travailler avec le ministre de la Santé, les provinces et les territoires afin de faire former jusqu’à 50 000 nouveaux préposés aux services de soutien à la personne.&#xD;

En plus de prévoir le prolongement des prestations de maladie (de 15 à 26 semaines), le plan comprend :&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-emploi pour les travailleurs autonomes canadiens, qui fournirait un soutien en cas de chômage comparable à celui qu’offre l’assurance-emploi pouvant s’étendre sur 26 semaines;&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation de 15 semaines pour les parents adoptifs;&#xD;
une nouvelle prestation d’assurance-carrière pour offrir aux travailleurs de longue date qui ont perdu leur emploi un revenu d’emploi additionnel pendant qu’ils tentent de réintégrer le marché du travail;&#xD;
la prise en compte des réalités des artistes et des travailleurs du secteur de la culture.&#xD;
Finaliser et rendre public le Plan d’action pour l’inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap, en consultation avec la communauté des personnes en situation de handicap. Ce Plan comprend des mesures immédiates dans des secteurs importants comme la sécurité financière et l’emploi et prévoit la création d’espaces inclusifs pour les personnes en situation de handicap et l’adoption d’une approche moderne et d’une définition commune à l’égard de l’invalidité dans l’ensemble du gouvernement du Canada. En plus des mesures qui seront instaurées par d’autres ministres, les mesures à prendre comprennent les suivantes :&#xD;
Mettre en œuvre une stratégie d’emploi pour les Canadiens en situation de handicap;&#xD;
Entreprendre un examen complet de l’accès aux programmes d’invalidité fédéraux, notamment pour les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale;&#xD;

Mettre en œuvre la Loi canadienne sur l’accessibilité et harmoniser les normes en matière d’accessibilité au Canada.&#xD;
Éliminer définitivement les intérêts sur les prêts d’études canadiens et les prêts canadiens aux apprentis. Faire passer à 50 000 $ le seuil du Programme d’aide au remboursement pour les étudiants emprunteurs qui sont célibataires et apporter les modifications appropriées aux seuils pour les familles de diverses tailles. Et permettre aux nouveaux parents de suspendre le remboursement de leurs prêts étudiants jusqu’à ce que leur plus jeune enfant ait cinq ans.&#xD;
Faire passer à 50 % l’effacement maximal de la dette auquel les médecins de famille, les résidents en médecine familiale, les infirmiers praticiens ou les infirmiers travaillant en régions rurales ou éloignées sont admissibles en vertu du Programme canadien de dispense de remboursement des prêts d’études. Élargir la liste actuelle des professionnels. Et entreprendre un examen pour s’assurer que les communautés rurales sont pleinement admissibles au programme afin d’améliorer l’accès aux soins de santé et aux services sociaux dans ces communautés.&#xD;
Pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone :&#xD;
Aider le ministre des Ressources naturelles et le ministre du Travail à favoriser l'adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires;&#xD;
Lancer un Centre de formation pour les emplois propres afin d’aider les travailleurs de tous les secteurs à mettre à niveau leurs compétences ou à en acquérir de nouvelles pour être à la fine pointe de l’industrie du carbone à zéro émission;&#xD;

Combler les lacunes en matière de formation et de perfectionnement afin que tous les travailleurs canadiens puissent profiter des débouchés durables offerts par l’industrie des batteries.&#xD;
Doubler le financement du Programme pour la formation et l’innovation en milieu syndical pour financer davantage de possibilités de formation en apprentissage et davantage de partenariats concernant les métiers du Sceau rouge partout au Canada, et pour accroître la participation de populations plus diverses, notamment des femmes, des Autochtones, des nouveaux arrivants, des personnes en situation de handicap, des Noirs et des Canadiens racisés. Continuer à faire la promotion du Service canadien d’apprentissage en partenariat avec les provinces, les territoires, les employeurs et les syndicats pour que les apprentis du Sceau rouge aient suffisamment d’occasions d’acquérir de l’expérience professionnelle, notamment auprès de petits et moyens employeurs, pour terminer leur formation à temps et trouver des emplois bien rémunérés.&#xD;
Continuer à soutenir le travail de la campagne nationale visant à promouvoir les métiers spécialisés comme des carrières de premier choix pour les jeunes et les populations diverses.&#xD;
Avec le ministre de l’Immigration, des Réfugiés et de la Citoyenneté, établir un système d’employeur de confiance pour les entreprises canadiennes embauchant des travailleurs étrangers temporaires et, dans cadre de l’amélioration du Volet des talents mondiaux du Programme des travailleurs étrangers temporaires, simplifier le renouvellement des permis, faire respecter le délai de traitement de deux semaines et créer une ligne d’assistance pour les employeurs. Continuer de travailler avec les provinces, les territoires et les organismes de réglementation pour améliorer la reconnaissance des titres de compétences étrangers.&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire, mettre en œuvre des permis de travail sectoriels et renforcer le régime d’inspection pour assurer la santé et la sécurité des travailleurs étrangers temporaires.&#xD;
Aider la ministre de l’Agriculture et de l’Agroalimentaire à élaborer une stratégie en matière de main-d’œuvre dans le secteur agricole pour combler les pénuries de main-d’œuvre chroniques et persistantes dans les secteurs de l’agriculture et de la transformation des aliments à court et long terme.&#xD;
Faciliter l’accès des femmes et des membres de groupes vulnérables à la formation en exigeant des entreprises bénéficiant du Programme de solutions pour la main-d’œuvre sectorielle qu’elles prévoient des mesures de soutien globales.&#xD;
Appuyer la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse dans le processus d’évaluation de l’ACS Plus afin d’améliorer le cadre et les paramètres de cet outil d’analyse, en portant une attention particulière à l’analyse intersectionnelle de diverses caractéristiques, parmi lesquelles l’ethnicité, l’identité autochtone, la ruralité, les handicaps et l’identité sexuelle.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député&#xD;

En tant que ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social, votre priorité immédiate est de mettre en place un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants qui permettra de réduire les frais exigés des parents, de créer plus de places de qualité, de recruter et de retenir des éducateurs qualifiés ainsi que de faire en sorte que tous les enfants bénéficient du meilleur départ possible dans la vie. Parallèlement, vous travaillerez avec des partenaires autochtones pour mettre en place un système d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants adapté à la culture autochtone. Par ailleurs, vous vous concentrerez sur la mise en œuvre du Fonds de relance des services communautaires afin d’aider les organismes de bienfaisance et les organismes sans but lucratif à s’adapter et à se moderniser, et vous veillerez à ce que Service Canada fournisse des services fiables et accessibles aux Canadiens, peu importe où ils vivent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, continuer à promouvoir la création et la durabilité d’un système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants, en prenant les mesures suivantes :&#xD;
Conclure les négociations avec les provinces et territoires restants, et mettre en œuvre des ententes :&#xD;

&#xD;
Monsieur le Ministre,&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous remercie d’avoir accepté de servir les Canadiens en tant que ministre du Travail.&#xD;
&#xD;
Depuis le début de la pandémie, les Canadiens ont dû faire face à un défi qui ne se produit qu’une fois par siècle. Malgré tout, les gens ont su se montrer à la hauteur, et ce, d’un océan à l’autre. Lorsque cela comptait le plus, les Canadiens se sont adaptés, se sont entraidés et ont fait preuve de compassion, de courage et de détermination, autant de valeurs qui nous sont chères. C’est ce qui a défini jusqu’à présent notre parcours dans cette pandémie. Et c’est ce qui nous permettra d’aller de l’avant.&#xD;
&#xD;
En cette période difficile, les Canadiens se sont prononcés de façon démocratique. Ils nous ont confié le soin de terminer la lutte contre la COVID-19 et de soutenir le rétablissement d’une classe moyenne forte. Ils nous ont, par le fait même, donné une orientation claire : prendre des mesures audacieuses et concrètes afin de bâtir un avenir où la santé et la résilience prévaudront. C’est ce que les Canadiens nous ont demandé, et c’est exactement ce que notre gouvernement est prêt à faire. Nous nous emploierons à bâtir cet avenir meilleur en continuant de miser sur la collaboration, la mobilisation, la science et la prise de décisions fondées sur des données probantes. En nous appliquant sans relâche à obtenir des résultats, nous travaillerons de manière constructive avec les parlementaires et maintiendrons nos solides partenariats avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, les administrations municipales et nos partenaires autochtones. Le début de cette nouvelle décennie a été extrêmement difficile, mais le moment est venu de rebâtir un pays plus résilient, plus inclusif et plus fort pour tous.&#xD;
&#xD;
La science est claire. Les Canadiens ont été clairs. Nous devons non seulement continuer d’agir concrètement à l’égard des changements climatiques, mais aussi le faire plus vite et aller plus loin à ce chapitre. Comme les Canadiens le constatent de plus en plus partout dans le pays, les changements climatiques constituent une menace existentielle. Afin de bâtir un avenir plus propre et plus vert, il nous faudra tous faire des efforts soutenus et concertés. Je m’attends à ce que vous cherchiez au sein de votre portefeuille, en votre qualité de ministre, des façons de soutenir nos efforts pangouvernementaux visant à réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, à créer des emplois propres et à relever les défis liés au climat avec lesquels les collectivités composent déjà.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cette année, les Canadiens ont été horrifiés par la découverte de sépultures non identifiées près d’anciens pensionnats autochtones. Ces découvertes nous rappellent la nécessité d’accélérer la réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, les Inuits et les Métis. Nous savons que cette réconciliation ne peut se faire sans l’obtention de la vérité, et le gouvernement continuera d’investir dans la quête de cette vérité. À titre de ministres, nous avons le devoir de faire progresser les travaux à cet égard, tant collectivement qu’individuellement. Par conséquent, je demande à chaque ministre de mettre en œuvre la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones et de travailler en partenariat avec les Autochtones pour faire mieux reconnaître leurs droits.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nous devons continuer de nous attaquer aux inégalités et aux disparités systémiques profondes qui demeurent présentes dans notre tissu social, notamment au sein de nos institutions fondamentales. À cet égard, il faut que les Canadiens de chacune des régions du pays puissent se reconnaître dans les priorités de notre gouvernement et dans ce que nous réalisons. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez, en votre qualité de ministre, avec diverses communautés dans un souci d’inclusion et cherchiez activement à obtenir les divers points de vue des Canadiens et à les intégrer dans votre travail. Cela comprend les femmes, les Autochtones, les Canadiens noirs et racisés, les nouveaux arrivants, les groupes confessionnels, les personnes en situation de handicap et les Canadiens LGBTQ2. Bien entendu, le tout doit se faire dans le respect des deux langues officielles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dans tous les aspects de notre travail, nous continuerons de nous assurer que les politiques publiques sont élaborées dans une perspective intersectionnelle, notamment par l’application de l’analyse comparative entre les sexes plus (ACS Plus) et des indicateurs de qualité de vie dans la prise de décisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens continuent de compter sur les journalistes et le journalisme pour obtenir des nouvelles exactes et en temps opportun. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations professionnelles et respectueuses avec les journalistes afin que les Canadiens soient bien informés et disposent des informations dont ils ont besoin pour assurer leur sécurité et celle de leur famille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout au long de la pandémie, les Canadiens et leurs gouvernements se sont adaptés à de nouvelles réalités. Les gouvernements doivent s’inspirer des leçons tirées de la pandémie pour s’adapter davantage et proposer des moyens plus flexibles et efficaces de servir les Canadiens. À cette fin, je m’attends à ce que tous les ministres se penchent sur des moyens d’actualiser nos façons de faire afin que le gouvernement puisse continuer de relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour assurer le succès de la présente législature, il faudra que les parlementaires, tant à la Chambre des communes qu’au Sénat, travaillent ensemble, tous partis confondus, dans le but de réaliser de grandes choses pour les Canadiens. Je m’attends à ce que vous entreteniez des relations constructives avec les porte-paroles de l’opposition, et à ce que vous coordonniez toute mesure législative avec le leader du gouvernement à la Chambre des communes. Dans votre rôle de ministre, vous êtes responsable devant le Parlement à la fois individuellement, de votre style de leadership et de l’accomplissement de vos responsabilités, et collectivement, à l’appui du Conseil des ministres et des décisions prises par le Cabinet. Le document Pour un gouvernement ouvert et responsable énonce ces principes fondamentaux et les normes de conduite que votre cabinet et vous devez respecter. Je m’attends à ce que vous vous familiarisiez avec ce document, qui décrit mes attentes à l’égard de chaque membre du Conseil des ministres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les engagements pris dans notre programme électoral sont ambitieux. L’achèvement de la lutte contre la pandémie doit demeurer au centre de nos préoccupations; toutefois, nous devons continuer de bâtir une classe moyenne forte et un avenir meilleur où chacun a une chance réelle et équitable de réussir et où personne n’est laissé pour compte.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tant que ministre du Travail, vos priorités immédiates sont de collaborer avec les milieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination contre la COVID-19 y soit obligatoire, et de modifier le Code canadien du travail de sorte que tous les travailleurs régis par les lois fédérales aient droit à 10 jours de congés de maladie payés. Je m’attends à ce que vous collaboriez avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les organisations représentant les travailleurs, ainsi qu’avec vos homologues provinciaux et territoriaux, pour rendre les lieux de travail plus sécuritaires et équitables pour toutes les personnes à l’échelle du pays et à ce que vous chapeautiez nos efforts visant à éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Poursuivre la collaboration avec les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale pour veiller à ce que la vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 soit mise en œuvre.&#xD;
Obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail pour accorder 10 jours de congé de maladie payés à tous les travailleurs sous réglementation fédérale, et convoquer les provinces et les territoires pour élaborer un plan d’action national dans le but de légiférer les congés de maladie dans tout le pays, tout en respectant les compétences provinciales et territoriales et les besoins uniques des propriétaires de petites entreprises.&#xD;
Terminer l’élaboration d’une politique de droit de se déconnecter, de concert avec les employeurs sous réglementation fédérale et les groupes syndicaux.&#xD;
Aller de l’avant et obtenir l’adoption de modifications au Code canadien du travail afin d’inclure la santé mentale en tant qu’élément particulier des normes de santé et de sécurité au travail et d’exiger des employeurs sous réglementation fédérale qu’ils prennent des mesures préventives visant à résoudre les problèmes de stress et les risques de blessures au travail.&#xD;
Modifier le Code canadien du travail afin de prévoir jusqu’à cinq jours de congé payés de plus pour les employés sous réglementation fédérale qui vivent une situation de fausse couche ou de mort à la naissance, et de renforcer les dispositions visant à mieux soutenir les travailleuses qui doivent être réaffectées pendant la grossesse et l’allaitement.&#xD;
Continuer à travailler avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux pour mettre pleinement en œuvre la Convention sur la violence et le harcèlement de 2019 de l’Organisation internationale du Travail et continuer à appuyer les employeurs et les syndicats pour renforcer les mesures de prévention du harcèlement et de la violence dans les lieux de travail de compétence fédérale.&#xD;
Diriger les efforts pour fournir des produits d’hygiène féminine gratuits dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale afin de favoriser la participation des femmes au travail.&#xD;
Avec l’appui de la présidente du Conseil du Trésor, du ministre du Logement et de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion et de la ministre des Femmes et de l’Égalité des genres et de la Jeunesse, travailler à accélérer l’examen de la Loi sur l’équité en matière d’emploi et assurer la mise en œuvre rapide des améliorations nécessaires.&#xD;
Moderniser le Programme de contrats fédéraux pour veiller à ce que les entrepreneurs fédéraux paient à leurs employés le salaire minimum fédéral, de façon à respecter les engagements relatifs au leadership sur les plans environnemental, social et de la gouvernance et à l’approvisionnement du gouvernement.&#xD;
Continuer à faire progresser la mise en œuvre de la Loi sur l’équité salariale dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale.&#xD;
Créer un processus de négociation collective plus équitable dans les lieux de travail sous réglementation fédérale en faisant avancer des mesures législatives qui interdisent le recours à des travailleurs de remplacement lorsqu’un employeur syndiqué met ses employés en lock-out.&#xD;
Appuyer la vice-première ministre et ministre des Finances dans l’introduction d’un crédit d’impôt pour la mobilité de la main-d’œuvre permettant aux travailleurs des secteurs du bâtiment et de la construction de déduire les frais admissibles de déplacement et de réinstallation temporaire.&#xD;
Travailler avec le ministre des Ressources naturelles pour favoriser l’adoption d’un projet de loi et de mesures exhaustives pour assurer une transition équitable. Ce travail s’appuiera sur les consultations menées auprès de travailleurs, de syndicats, de peuples autochtones, d’employeurs, de communautés, de provinces et de territoires pour soutenir l’avenir et la qualité de vie des travailleurs et de leurs communautés dans le cadre de la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone. Vous recevrez l’appui de la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap et des ministres responsables des agences de développement régional.&#xD;
Travailler à des modifications qui permettront aux travailleurs à l’emploi de grandes plateformes numériques de bénéficier d’une sécurité d’emploi en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Vous collaborerez également avec la ministre de l’Emploi, du Développement de la main-d’œuvre et de l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap pour veiller à ce que ces travailleurs bénéficient de prestations et de mesures de soutien.&#xD;
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Sécurité publique, de la ministre des Services publics et de l’Approvisionnement et de la ministre du Commerce international, de la Promotion des exportations, de la Petite Entreprise et du Développement économique, présenter un projet de loi pour éliminer le travail forcé des chaînes d’approvisionnement canadiennes et faire en sorte que les entreprises canadiennes qui mènent des activités à l’étranger ne contribuent pas à des violations des droits de la personne.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;

En tant que ministre des Aînés, votre priorité immédiate est de soutenir et de faire progresser l’engagement pris par le gouvernement d’augmenter la Sécurité de la vieillesse et le Supplément de revenu garanti. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des soins de longue durée, et à prendre des mesures concrètes pour soutenir les aînés qui veulent vieillir chez eux. De plus, vous continuerez de créer des possibilités pour les aînés d’entretenir plus de liens, d’obtenir du soutien et d’être des membres actifs de leur communauté en mettant en œuvre le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour atteindre ces objectifs, je vous demande d’obtenir des résultats pour les Canadiens en vous acquittant des engagements suivants.&#xD;
&#xD;
En tablant sur notre engagement à l’égard de la Sécurité de la vieillesse, augmenter le Supplément de revenu garanti de 500 $ pour les aînés vivant seuls et de 750 $ pour les couples, à compter de l’âge de 65 ans.&#xD;
Veiller à ce que la Prestation canadienne d’urgence (PCU) et la Prestation canadienne de la relance économique (PCRE) n’aient pas d’incidence négative sur l’admissibilité des aînés au Supplément de revenu garanti.&#xD;
Avec l’appui du ministre de la Santé, créer un comité d’experts chargé de formuler des recommandations sur la mise en œuvre d’une allocation Vieillir chez soi.&#xD;
Aider les organismes communautaires à fournir un soutien pratique pour aider les aînés à faibles revenus ou autrement vulnérables à vivre chez eux aussi longtemps que possible, et appuyer les projets régionaux et nationaux qui facilitent l’expansion de services ayant déjà fait leurs preuves pour ce qui est d’aider les aînés à demeurer dans leur domicile.&#xD;
Travailler avec la ministre de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social pour fournir aux aînés un point d’accès unique à un vaste éventail de services et de prestations du gouvernement.&#xD;
Continuer de collaborer avec le ministre de la Justice et procureur général du Canada pour renforcer l’approche du Canada à l’égard de la maltraitance des personnes âgées en mettant la dernière main à la définition nationale des mauvais traitements infligés aux aînés, en investissant des fonds pour améliorer la collecte de données, et en établissant dans le Code criminel de nouvelles infractions et de nouvelles sanctions liées à la maltraitance des aînés.&#xD;
Représenter le gouvernement du Canada au Forum des ministres fédéral, provinciaux et territoriaux responsables des aînés.&#xD;
Continuer de diriger les travaux d’Emploi et Développement social Canada portant sur les programmes destinés aux aînés, ce qui comprend le programme Nouveaux Horizons pour les aînés.&#xD;
Aider le ministre de la Santé à améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des établissements et des lits de soins de longue durée. Pour ce faire, travailler avec les provinces et territoires pour améliorer les mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections, définir les principes communs et élaborer des normes nationales afin que les aînés reçoivent les soins qu’ils méritent.&#xD;
En tant que ministre, vous devez également collaborer activement avec vos collègues du Cabinet et du caucus. Pour remplir nos engagements, il faudra que les membres du Conseil des ministres continuent de collaborer et de travailler de manière constructive pour soutenir un processus décisionnel rigoureux et productif au sein du Cabinet. Je m’attends à ce que vous aidiez vos collègues à s’acquitter de leurs engagements, notamment en tirant parti de l’expertise de votre ministère et de vos propres expériences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pour que les Canadiens obtiennent les meilleurs résultats possible, les ministres doivent faire preuve de rigueur et coordonner leurs efforts de mise en œuvre. Je vous prie donc de m’indiquer la démarche que vous entendez suivre pour réaliser les engagements liés à votre mandat, ainsi que les priorités que vous comptez mettre en œuvre dans les plus brefs délais. De plus, pour que nous soyons responsables de notre travail, je vous demanderai de me communiquer publiquement, ainsi qu’à tous les Canadiens, les progrès accomplis dans la réalisation de ces engagements, et ce, de façon périodique.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comme on nous l’a rappelé tout au long de la pandémie, il est non seulement souhaitable mais aussi impératif que le gouvernement s’adapte au changement. Alors que vous vous emploierez à concrétiser nos engagements, je m’attends à ce que vous preniez activement en considération les nouvelles idées et questions qui se font jour, que ce soit à la lumière de consultations menées auprès de la population, de votre travail avec les parlementaires ou de conseils formulés par la fonction publique. Je m’attends également à ce que vous travailliez avec votre sous-ministre pour réévaluer sans cesse les priorités à mesure que nous bâtissons un avenir meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. En plus de l’atteinte des résultats, vous êtes responsable de superviser le travail de votre ministère et de veiller au bon fonctionnement de votre portefeuille.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous demande de respecter les principes de l’équité, de la diversité et de l’inclusion lorsque vous embaucherez du personnel pour votre cabinet et mettrez en œuvre des stratégies d’information et de recrutement pour les postes de direction et de membres de conseils dont les titulaires sont nommés par le gouvernement fédéral. Nous contribuerons ainsi à faire en sorte que les milieux de travail au gouvernement fédéral soient dynamiques et représentatifs de la population que nous servons. Vous devez également veiller à ce que votre cabinet et votre portefeuille ministériel tiennent compte de notre engagement relativement à des milieux de travail sains et sécuritaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
Les Canadiens veulent que nous travaillions fort, que nous parlions avec franchise et que nous ayons à cœur de promouvoir leurs intérêts et aspirations. Lorsque nous commettrons des erreurs, et nous le ferons tous, les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que nous les reconnaissions et, surtout, à ce que nous en tirions des leçons.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour vous acquitter des importantes responsabilités qui vous sont confiées. Sachez que vous pouvez me consulter ainsi que la vice-première ministre, dès maintenant et souvent, pour que nous puissions vous soutenir dans votre rôle de ministre.&#xD;
&#xD;
Je vous prie d’agréer, Madame la Ministre, l’expression de ma considération respectueuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
Le très hon. Justin Trudeau, c.p., député&#xD;
Premier ministre du Canada&#xD;

      <documentation>Employment and Social Development Canada’s Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is the largest information technology project undertaken to date by the federal government. The programme had 2 key goals:&#xD;
• migrate Old Age Security, Employment Insurance, and Canada Pension Plan benefits to a modern cloud‑based platform&#xD;
• transform benefits delivery and the user experience to meet the needs of diverse groups, including seniors, people in remote locations, Indigenous peoples, and refugees&#xD;
The information technology systems currently used to deliver these benefits to Canadians are between 20 and 60 years old and at risk of failing. If these systems were to fail, it could greatly affect the more than 10 million Canadians who rely on them to meet their daily needs.&#xD;
We found that in the face of ongoing delays, cost increases, and staffing challenges, the department showed flexibility by adjusting its approach from working on both of the programme’s goals in tandem to prioritizing the migration of the aging systems to reduce the risk of system failure. However, this approach meant delaying the programme’s much‑needed transformation component, which is intended to improve how people access and receive these benefits, including reducing the occurrence of inaccurate payments. The programme is more than halfway into its initially planned timeline, and all 3 benefits are still operating on outdated systems with limitations.&#xD;
As time goes on and estimated costs continue to rise, we are concerned that decision makers may scale back or eliminate the transformation component of the 3 benefits, resulting in a final product that does not consider the needs of millions of Canadians who rely on them. The Benefits Delivery Modernization programme is an opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate how it could improve the planning and execution of large, multi‑year information technology projects.</documentation>

      <documentation>2.2.3 Program Alignment Architecture&#xD;
There are gaps in Canada’s social safety net and poverty among working-age persons with disabilities remains higher than those without disabilities. Building a more accessible Canada remains a top priority for the Government of Canada. At the centre of this work will be re-introducing legislation to create the Canada Disability Benefit, which would significantly reduce poverty in Canada and help ensure that working-age Canadians with disabilities live in dignity. Alongside this work, ESDC will continue to develop and implement the Disability Inclusion Action Plan and work toward the Accessible Canada Act goal of a barrier-free Canada by 2040.&#xD;
&#xD;
As per ESDC Departmental Results Framework 2023-24, CDB fits into ESDC core responsibility number 2 : Pensions and Benefits, as it aims to ensure that Persons with disabilities and their families have financial support.</documentation>

      <documentation>More than 6.2 million Canadians, including just over 4 million who are working-age (18-64), identify as having a disability, and approximately 1.6 million working-age Canadians have a severe or very severe disability. According to the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability (CSD), 917,000 working-age Canadians with disabilities experience poverty—twice the rate of their peers without disabilities (23% vs 12% based on Canada's Official Poverty Line, the Market Basket Measure (MBM)). The poverty rate increases with severity of disability, with 28% of persons with severe disabilities and 34% of persons with very severe disabilities living in poverty. Of those, 60% of persons with disabilities live in deep poverty (incomes below 75% of the MBM threshold). While this precarious financial situation is a long-term, ongoing, structural issue, it is only worsened in periods of financial stress (such as the current period of high inflation), which can push those already living on the edge deeper into poverty.</documentation>

      <documentation>The financial situation of working-age persons with disabilities improves significantly when they become eligible for Old Age Security/Guaranteed Income Supplement (OAS / GIS) – the rate of poverty drops from 23% for working-age persons with disabilities to 9% for those 65 years of age and older (2017 CSD). In contrast, for most working-age persons with disabilities who do not qualify for Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPPD) due to no or little labor market attachment, there are no federal supports beyond tax measures and long-term savings vehicles. P/T supports (which are income programs of last resort) are largely insufficient to lift persons with disabilities out of poverty. This is why the CDB aims to supplement rather than replace existing benefits. Given differences in eligibility and other criteria across P/T disability programs, supplementation will differ across P/Ts. With time, the CDB may stand alongside other statutory income supports as a foundational piece of Canada's social support system.</documentation>

      <documentation>Priority 1: Central AI capacity&#xD;
A common theme heard from government departments during consultations was a need for a central hub to support project implementation and share knowledge. AI accelerators or specialist technical teams able to support project teams with technical development are increasingly being established within departments. However, there is an unmet need for guidance on many other aspects of AI implementation. These include identifying use cases, evaluating data readiness, assessing risk, determining whether to build or buy solutions, and navigating assessment, governance, and procurement processes. Departments also commonly expressed a need for a convenor to share knowledge, code, scalable tools, and lessons learned from departmental experience.&#xD;

Over the past decade, more and more Government of Canada departments have established their own AI accelerators or centres of expertise to promote departmental adoption. Some examples of these include:&#xD;

National Research Council’s (NRC) AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs&#xD;
The NRC has promoted AI adoption across federal departments and agencies through its AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs, completing over 100 projects in the past five years. These initiatives span national security, digital privacy, digital health, scientific discovery, logistics, geospatial analytics, and Indigenous languages, improving public services, productivity, and situational awareness. With over 110 AI specialists and access to advanced computation facilities and global partnerships, the NRC supports and enhances AI initiatives across the Government of Canada, driving innovation and adoption for a more secure and technologically advanced nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shared Services Canada’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Program and AI Centre of Excellence (AICoE)&#xD;
The AI Program and the AICoE Incubate AI use cases, promote the use of AI, break down silos and foster digital innovation. Established in 2019, the AI Program has incubated more than 15 use cases, including CANChat. The AI CoE supports Government of Canada exploration of AI and intelligent automation, providing a central repository for sharing best practices, training materials, and strategic guidance. It convenes AI and intelligent automation working groups to explore challenges and identify opportunities and solutions to accelerate responsible adoption. The AI CoE also provides guidance to departments embarking on AI adoption and contributes to Algorithmic Impact Assessment peer review and the development of policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Natural Resources Canada's Digital Accelerator&#xD;
NRCan works with scientists, economists and researchers to pilot advanced solutions and tools, including AI, strengthen digital expertise and literacy in the department and sector, and future-proof the department and its partners. Its projects include platforms or tools for accelerated materials discovery, mineral detection, industrial systems performance optimization, and grid optimization for electric vehicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Establish an AI Centre of Expertise for the Government of Canada&#xD;
The AI Centre of Expertise (AI CoE) will complement services offered by existing accelerators and centres, focusing on project support, knowledge sharing, and strategic guidance to support AI adoption and experimentation. It will provide project guidance, advise on common processes, and share best practice, experience, knowledge and code. It will also encourage interdepartmental or whole-of-government collaboration on solutions for common needs. The AI CoE will help business teams to:&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify high-value use cases for AI integration. This may include helping departments evaluate factors like task and data suitability; infrastructure, model, and data requirements and limitations; cost/benefit analysis; privacy, accessibility, environmental, and equity considerations; risk identification, evaluation, and mitigation; workforce impacts; and how to evaluate project success against objectives.&#xD;
Support data readiness: This would include supporting the implementation of the 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service as a critical enabler for AI adoption. The AI CoE could advise departments on preparing their data for AI use or training and identifying Government of Canada datasets that could be combined to enable AI.&#xD;
Support with procurement, governance, assessments, review processes, and other requirements. This would include providing guidance on options for procurement; algorithmic, accessibility, language, privacy, and environmental impact assessments; transparency, reporting, ethics, bias, peer review, GBA Plus analysis, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty requirements; securing AI and understanding risks; and processes for explanation and recourse. It will also include providing input into the development of a governance framework (see Priority 2) and the creation of standard language to inform vendors of their role in responsible AI adoption.&#xD;
In addition to supporting project teams, the AI CoE will act as:&#xD;
&#xD;
A convenor for government-wide knowledge sharing. It will share successful initiatives to prevent duplication of effort, maximize return on investment, and promote awareness and adoption of existing approved solutions. This will include sharing government-developed code and solutions, project documentation, information, policy, and instruments; soliciting feedback, use cases, and lessons learned from departments; and encouraging the scaling of successful projects. It will also work with the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) to identify and promote training priorities and provide input into new policy or procurement vehicles.&#xD;
An accelerator for AI solutions to meet common Government of Canada needs. Working with departments, the AI CoE will identify potential solutions that meet government-wide needs that could be broadly scaled and support their development.&#xD;
A monitor of progress on AI adoption. The AI CoE will develop frameworks for progress and impact of Government of Canada AI adoption that can be used to benchmark, monitor, and report on the progress and compliance with policy and standards.&#xD;
Enable common infrastructure&#xD;
The Government of Canada and departments will ensure the provision of common infrastructure to enable AI adoption and will promote the adoption of existing approved enterprise solutions. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructure that is available, secure, and scalable to meet the demands of AI projects. &#xD;
common data and information management systems and practices to support sharing, scaling, and agentic capabilities across Government of Canada platforms.&#xD;
access to approved models, services, and application programming interfaces (APIs) within common Government of Canada cloud platforms to build or deploy systems.&#xD;
access to common AI solutions and capabilities in vendor solutions through a standard Government of Canada platform service.&#xD;
Where possible, they will support Canadian suppliers and vendors in order to promote the growth of the Canadian AI industry and ensure secure sovereign infrastructure and solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify and develop a lighthouse project&#xD;
This project will be either a new initiative or one currently at pilot stage that would meet an enterprise-wide need and could be readily scaled. Its development, testing, and delivery will be undertaken collaboratively by the AI CoE and lead department. It will serve as:&#xD;
&#xD;
A test case to identify barriers and project teams’ needs for support during development and obstacles to subsequent customization and scaling.&#xD;
A pilot for the development of government-wide governance processes (see Priority 2 ).&#xD;
An opportunity to develop templates and examples of project documentation.&#xD;
A demonstration of the value of AI use cases.&#xD;
Learn more about: The lighthouse project&#xD;
The Strategy proposes the development of a lighthouse project that would both meet an enterprise-wide need and provide an opportunity to develop and test Government of Canada governance and support processes for AI adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
As its first lighthouse project, TBS will work with the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to scale its self-serve language hub pilot across the Government of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Translation Bureau has developed a self-serve language hub pilot to provide PSPC employees with access to a variety of secure, real-time AI-driven language tools, trained with Canadian data. These include automated translation tools that can be used to provide instant translations of low-risk and low-value documents. The service operates in a secure cloud up to Protected B, with all data centralized within the Bureau and housed in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
For users, this would provide a secure and approved one-stop shop for linguistic needs. For the Government, availability of an approved automated tool would reduce translation costs without compromising data security or sovereignty or product quality. Use of the Translation Bureau’s repository of 8 billion words (2 TB) to train the model would ensure a high level of consistency, quality, and customization to the specificities of Canadian culture, identity and realities.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="Priority 2: Policy, legislation and governance (Value)" id="id-50e26c179d574e5eb9ffffea8db520ad">
      <documentation>Priority 2: Policy, legislation, and governance&#xD;
Responsible AI adoption needs clear, up-to-date legislation and policy. Together, they mark out not only the necessary guardrails for identifying and mitigating risk, but also the space within which developers are free to experiment and innovate. Clear legislation and policy help to build public trust, overcome institutional resistance to AI innovation and enable governments to move further and faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
As in many jurisdictions, some Canadian legislation and federal policy has not been revised for the AI era. Some law or policy is silent on areas needed to govern AI, while others may introduce unintended bias in data collection or obstruct AI adoption unnecessarily and unintentionally. Incremental development has created a patchwork of policies that are difficult for AI project teams to understand and navigate, and no common model for AI governance yet exists within the Government of Canada. These challenges must be addressed to build public confidence in the Government of Canada’s ability to deliver AI-enabled services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: AI-ready law and policy&#xD;
Policy, law, and regulations must support the use of AI and must be kept updated to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as technology evolves.  In response, the Government of Canada and leading jurisdictions worldwide have begun to incorporate commitments to scheduled review cycles into key laws and policy instruments, a new best practice that should be more widely adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government of Canada’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making and associated Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool are reviewed every two years. &#xD;
Amendments made in 2019 to the Access to Information Act include a 5-year review cycle.&#xD;
The EU AI Act includes provisions for an annual review of both its list of high-risk AI systems and the AI practices it prohibits.&#xD;
Even without a specified review cycle, other jurisdictions regularly review and amend key legislation and policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
Australia has conducted regular reviews of its Privacy Act 1988 to address emerging privacy issues and technological developments, with four major reviews since its enactment.&#xD;
The EU regularly reviews its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other technology-related laws to adapt to new technological advancements and challenges.&#xD;
Lastly, some jurisdictions have developed guidance to ensure that all new legislation supports new technologies by design.&#xD;
&#xD;
Denmark’s digital-ready legislation program has established mandatory assessment against seven principles for digitally-ready legislation to ensure that new laws and regulations are compatible with digital technologies and can be efficiently administered using digital tools.&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Establish common AI governance and risk management frameworks&#xD;
Drawing on international and Government of Canada best practice, the Government of Canada will establish common governance and risk management frameworks for the AI lifecycle to provide clear guidance to AI project teams. These frameworks will balance risk with the pace required for innovation; be scaled to system risk, sensitivity, and impact; and will be designed to adapt as technology changes. They will address potential risks associated with AI use, such as data privacy and security, bias detection and mitigation, model interpretability and explainability, environmental impact, and human involvement. The frameworks will incorporate Canadian requirements, such as the need to advance Indigenous Data Sovereignty and provide technologies in both official languages. They will also lay out the security, trust, and reliability controls necessary to ensure the continued maintenance and resilience of these systems, including system shutdown measures to respond to emergencies. This work will support ongoing efforts to harmonize data standards, increase interoperability, and support other enablers.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, it will include a government-wide governance structure responsible for implementing the governance framework. This will include an AI ethics review board responsible for providing guidance on responsible AI and for evaluating higher risk and impact projects at key stages of the project lifecycle. The governance structure will make use of existing Government of Canada governance bodies and organizations such as the Canada AI Safety Institute wherever possible. In addition to providing project governance, these bodies and organizations will help identify high-value AI use cases, regularly reprioritize the AI Strategy's actions, and prioritize and oversee the AI Strategy's implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Address policy and legislative alignment, gaps, and barriers&#xD;
The Government of Canada will review and propose changes to instruments that create unnecessary obstacles to AI adoption. It will fill identified policy gaps, such as clarifying the responsibilities of chief information, data and privacy officers for AI adoption, and the acceptable use of AI by outside organizations in their interactions with the Government of Canada. It will also address legal and policy ambiguities related to privacy and training data and the application of the national security exemption. The Government of Canada will update procurement policies, instruments and processes to make them more responsive to pace and requirements of AI procurement. It will also consider ways in which the Government of Canada can better align internal AI policy with the Pan Canadian AI Strategy to support the Canadian AI sector, with the United Nations Declaration Act commitments to Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and with international treaties, legislation and norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
This work will lead to the development of clear and concrete commitments to revise specific instruments within a set timeline, and an agile process to review and update policy, guidance, tools and resources to respond to technological, legislative and social change. The Government of Canada will also review the policy landscape for opportunities to synthesize or interpret existing policy to increase usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopt a “think AI” approach&#xD;
The Government of Canada will optimize its AI adoption by embedding a “think AI” approach to its policies, programs and services. The intent is not to adopt AI at all costs or in contexts where its use would not be responsible or useful. Rather, the goal is to challenge departments to identify key business problems that could be transformed using AI, consider AI options before defaulting to traditional IT or HR approaches, and make planned investments in AI and its enablers.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support this, the Government of Canada will require departments to:&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify three areas, programs or services with business problems that have a high potential to be solved using AI.&#xD;
Consider solutions and resourcing requirements for AI and its enablers at the outset of initiatives. This will include changes to Treasury Board submissions, Memoranda to Cabinet, and budget and off-cycle funding proposals to incorporate data, AI, compute, and other relevant requirements.&#xD;
Prioritize AI infrastructure and secure adoption in departmental integrated IT planning processes.&#xD;
Develop their own AI strategies to ensure alignment and effective use of resources.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="Priority 3: Talent and training (Value)" id="id-3db2193f082f47888beda2e3603503bc">
      <documentation>Priority 3: Talent and training&#xD;
To adopt AI responsibly, we need people with the right technical and non-technical skills. Although Canada is a global leader in AI research, demand for AI skills significantly outpaces supply. Within the Government of Canada, there is a 30% vacancy rate for digital roles, threatening delivery and leading to a costly dependence on external contractors. As it plans for increased AI adoption, the Government of Canada must consider how it will meet its AI talent needs through training, upskilling, and recruitment so that it can optimize its use of AI to serve Canadians better.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Develop a training plan&#xD;
Building on existing offerings from CSPS, the Government of Canada will develop a training plan for existing public servants. The developed training plan will be evergreen to match the pace of AI development. Through this plan, the Government of Canada will consider ways that AI may reshape the workforce, working with employees and their bargaining agents to prepare public servants for this change through retraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
The training plan will incorporate both general training and training tailored to specific personas with varying roles, levels and responsibilities. The general training will be directed at increasing understanding of and confidence in using AI, including embedded AI capabilities; developing skills associated with responsible, secure, and effective use, including effective prompt engineering; and establishing leadership programs to achieve a culture that promotes AI adoption. The tailored training will address both more specific and advanced technical skills, and the behavioural skills needed for successful adoption, such risk identification and management, and effective leadership of AI projects and teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
Benchmark talent needs&#xD;
The Government of Canada will benchmark both talent requirements for AI and its employees’ existing AI knowledge and skills across the enterprise. These benchmarks will enable the development of learner personas with accompanying training plans and identify employees who could be offered further training.&#xD;
&#xD;
Develop a talent plan&#xD;
Since not all talent needs can be met through training, the Government of Canada will need to develop a plan to recruit and retain talent. This plan will explore obstacles to recruitment and retention and ways to establish flexible data science career pathways for AI practitioners. It will also consider ways to expand interchanges, apprenticeships, co-op programs, and partnerships with AI institutes and research centres to create a talent pipeline. It will consider ways to make efficient use of AI talent through flexible assignments, and competitions and challenges to meet some project-based needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: AI and data talent pathways&#xD;
To meet the challenge of AI talent needs, both departmental and government-wide initiatives are being developed to improve recruitment, retention, and reskilling:&#xD;
&#xD;
Digital Talent Strategy and Platform:&#xD;
The Government of Canada is committed to strengthening AI talent and adoption through the Government of Canada Digital Talent Strategy. Its targeted initiatives include centralized AI-specific recruitment campaigns for data science graduates and the Digital Talent Platform, which simplifies the application process for individuals looking for digital careers in the Government of Canada and helps managers to find pre-qualified digital talent that matches their needs. The Strategy also focuses on developing and retaining AI talent through learning platforms, training opportunities, and partnerships with educational institutions and the Canada School of Public Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
Training:&#xD;
CSPS offers a range of courses, events, and resources on AI designed to provide users with a grounding in the knowledge and skills needed for successful and responsible use. These include a data and AI learning pathway, courses, job aids, articles, and videos, and an AI event series.&#xD;
&#xD;
Co-op programs and internships:&#xD;
Co-op programs are widely used by the Government of Canada as a source of new talent but have also been reimagined to support specific AI initiatives. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada established an AI talent pipeline with three post-secondary institutions. Through it, AAFC hired 13 co-op students in 2023-24 and supported in-class projects with the institutions. From this partnership, students received course credit and employment experience, while AAFC received an AI model, with ownership of both IP and data. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Employment and Social Development Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and Statistics Canada have become partners with Mila, offering opportunities to recruit Mila students for internships or post-graduation roles.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="Priority 4: Engagement, transparency, and value to Canadians (Value)" id="id-df6c392d106546069917fcb593891e1f">
      <documentation>Priority 4: Engagement, accountability, and transparency, and value to Canadians&#xD;
Despite the increasing use of AI in Canada, levels of mistrust in AI and its use are high. In public consultations on the AI Strategy, participants expressed a desire for more engagement in the process of designing and developing government AI systems, especially by those more greatly impacted by algorithmic bias or barriers to access. They asked for greater transparency about the government’s AI use through labelling of AI-generated products and information on systems in use, and for information about ways to seek explanations or recourse for decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key actions&#xD;
Strengthen accountability and transparency on AI use&#xD;
The Government of Canada will continue to strengthen and clarify accountabilities for AI use in policy and in notifications about AI use. These will include new requirements and standard language for the disclosure of AI use, explanations of how an AI system reaches a decision, and information about rights and protections, including how to seek explanations or recourse and how to report problems. Lastly, the Government of Canada will identify those AI capabilities that it will not pursue.&#xD;
&#xD;
As part of these efforts, the Government of Canada will prioritize the establishment of a public register of its AI systems. The register will include information about all AI systems that fall within a defined scope, drawing wherever possible on information already collected through Algorithmic Impact Assessments and Personal Information Banks. The scope of the register will be defined and publicized on the register itself and will follow best practice for registers in other jurisdictions, which exclude embedded AI systems and any systems covered by specific policy prohibiting publication. The register will include information about what and how data is being used, how it was trained, and what quality assurance and privacy and security measures are in place. Where information about systems cannot be published, the Government of Canada will develop and publish alternative oversight processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Demonstrate impact and value to Canadians&#xD;
To ensure good stewardship of public resources, the Government of Canada will develop metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate the impact and value of AI initiatives to those we serve. This will track both the cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of AI projects through a range of financial and non-monetary metrics, including costs of implementation, efficiencies and cost savings achieved, service improvements, increased client satisfaction, or increased program uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government of Canada will also develop a framework to track AI adoption. This framework will incorporate metrics for the deployment of AI solutions overall, but also for metrics such as collaboration, sharing, or scaling of solutions to avoid duplication of effort, maximize investment, and reduce costs. The metrics will also track departmental investments in the enablers of AI, including data, infrastructure, and talent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Commit to engagement on AI&#xD;
In keeping with its commitments to meaningful public engagement through the Directive on Open Government, and with the duty to consult, the Government of Canada commits to early and meaningful public and stakeholder engagement on AI initiatives of significant public interest or concern. This will include targeted engagement of communities that face greater impacts, risks or barriers from AI systems and union and employee engagement on workforce impacts. It will also include client participation in system design to ensure that AI systems do not create or perpetuate barriers to access for clients. The Government of Canada will also provide mechanisms for ongoing public feedback and questions on AI used by the federal government.&#xD;
&#xD;
Learn more about: Public AI registers&#xD;
Public AI registers are standardized, searchable databases that document the decisions, assumptions, and processes involved in the lifecycle of AI algorithms used by government organizations. AI registers usually include:&#xD;
&#xD;
A non-technical overview of the AI application’s goals, use cases, and impacts.&#xD;
The organizations responsible for the system.&#xD;
Stage and date of system development.&#xD;
Some registers also include information on&#xD;
&#xD;
Data origins, management, processing, and quality issues.&#xD;
Model architecture, key features, parameters, performance, and source code.&#xD;
Bias, accessibility, and how those impacted were involved in system development.&#xD;
Risk levels and mitigation, risk-benefit trade-offs, and impact assessments.&#xD;
Human oversight in development, decision cycles, and monitoring.&#xD;
How those impacted can seek an explanation for decisions.&#xD;
Relevant privacy policies, information and system governance models, supplier contracts, and audit reports.&#xD;
Most registers exclude AI that is embedded within commercial products, such as virtual assistants or spell checkers, but encourage organizations to default to reporting systems if unsure whether they qualify. They also exclude systems that fall under law or policy prohibiting public disclosure, which may be reported to oversight bodies instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
From 2020 to 2024, under Executive Order 14110, the US government required all federal agencies to publish an annual inventory of their planned, new, and existing AI use cases, with exclusions only for very simple rule-based systems, robotic process automation, and defence systems. Other jurisdictions with AI registers include the Netherlands and Scotland, state governments of Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Catalonia, and municipalities of Amsterdam, Helsinki and San Jose.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Value" name="AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service 2025-2027: Priority areas" id="id-6ba5df5ffbc647259c6ddf1282f08e2a">
      <documentation>Priority areas&#xD;
Canada’s AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service focuses on four priority areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
Priority 1: Central AI capacity&#xD;
Priority 2: Policy, legislation and governance&#xD;
Priority 3: Talent and training&#xD;
Priority 4: Engagement, transparency, and value to Canadians&#xD;
These priorities were developed in collaboration with a working group of departments that have responsibilities for AI policy or implementation. They were discussed throughout our consultation with partners, stakeholders and the public and in policy consultations across the Government of Canada. They address what we heard as the most pressing needs to advance responsible adoption of AI across the Government of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each of these priorities has a set of accompanying actions. These have been chosen because they are concrete, can be achieved or initiated within the AI Strategy’s two-year timeline, and have the greatest potential to advance responsible AI adoption within the public service. These actions include both ongoing and new work. Some will build on work already begun, or scale innovations and emerging best practices. Others are new actions to respond to emerging needs and known barriers that must be addressed if AI adoption is to succeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
These priorities and the associated actions reflect the time when the AI Strategy was developed. Because the future pace and direction of AI development is highly uncertain, what we and our partners, stakeholders, and clients identify as priorities may be very different at the end of the Strategy’s lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
To remain relevant in this rapidly changing landscape, the AI Strategy and its implementation plan will be reviewed frequently and will be renewed in 2027. Progress on implementation will be reported on a quarterly tracker. In this way we will model the agility needed for AI adoption, adapting our priorities to meet new needs while continuing to collaborate with users and engage those we serve.</documentation>

Canadian Press Newswire&#xD;
Published: 2025-05-21&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney says single government mandate letter reflects a 'unified mission'&#xD;
&#xD;
OTTAWA _ Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out a handful of collective core priorities for his new ministers on Wednesday, vowing his government will work to bring down the cost of living and reconfigure some of Canada's most important international relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney released just one single mandate letter publicly for his entire cabinet, rather than the traditional spate of individual assignments. He said this shows every member of his cabinet shares ''a unified mission.''&#xD;
&#xD;
''This one letter outlines the core priorities of Canada's new government, reflecting the mandate that Canadians have given to us,'' he said.&#xD;
&#xD;
''The government is charged to build the strongest economy in the G7, an economy that works for everyone, to bring down the cost of living for Canadian families, to keep our country's security -- our communities -- safe, to develop a new economic and security relationship with the United States, and to build new partnerships with reliable allies around the world.''&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney made the comments while speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill after holding a secretive, two-day retreat with his new cabinet in Gatineau, Que.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a break from the tradition followed by Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, media were not allowed on site at Meech Lake to ask ministers questions _ placing the spotlight squarely on Carney this evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
Several ministers made headlines in the last week by giving conflicting messages to the media on pipeline policy, reporting there would be no budget until fall and declaring that lowering housing prices would be the wrong approach to making homes more affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
The letter explicitly directs them to assess how they should proceed to govern through their individual departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
''Over the coming weeks, I will look to each of you to identify the key goals and measures of success on which to evaluate the results you will achieve for Canadians as a member of the Ministry,'' the letter reads.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the mandate letter, Carney also said he expects each cabinet committee, led by a chair, to ''drive and monitor'' progress. He said that should be done with oversight from the priorities, planning and strategy committee _ chaired by the prime minister _ and direction from the full cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
A number of new cabinet committees were announced last week that reflect the government's focus on shoring up Canada's sovereignty and improving the quality of life of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
They include a new ''Build Canada'' committee, focused on strengthening Canada's economy and a committee on government transformation and efficiency, aiming to reduce government spending.&#xD;
&#xD;
Other new groups include a committee on operations and parliamentary affairs, a committee for ''quality of life and wellbeing'' and a committee on a ''secure and sovereign Canada'' that aims to reinforce Canadian sovereignty, manage Canada-U.S. relations and advance Canada's interests around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney spoke with journalists after emerging from what his office called a cabinet ''planning forum'' held at Meech Lake to prepare for the new sitting of Parliament that starts next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the press conference Wednesday, Carney was also asked about Liberal MPs considering adopting Reform Act rules to have the power to trigger a leadership review.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said all recognized parties in Parliament are bound by the Reform Act and that votes will take place at the first caucus meeting on Sunday.&#xD;
&#xD;
''I observe that this will happen,'' Carney said.&#xD;
&#xD;
The new minority Parliament meets for the first time on Monday to elect a new House Speaker and will watch King Charles III deliver the speech from the throne on Tuesday.&#xD;

Carney's singular mandate letter a welcome change, promises 'narrow' focus for upcoming Parliament, say insiders&#xD;
By: Marco Vigliotti&#xD;
&#xD;
Prime Minister Mark Carney released his mandate letter to cabinet on Wednesday, spelling out a broad list of priorities for his re-elected Liberal government, including establishing a new economic and security relationship with the U.S., removing internal trade barriers and reducing costs for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
It represents a break from the tradition established by Justin Trudeau, where each minister received instructions unique to their portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said Canadians &quot;elected a new government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone,&quot; and his cabinet &quot;must fulfill this mandate with purpose and force.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;We must meet a series of unprecedented challenges with both a disciplined focus on core priorities and new approaches to governing.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney's seven priorities for cabinet are mostly restated commitments from the this past spring's election campaign, including safeguarding Canadian sovereignty by bolstering border security and strengthening the military, returning immigration rates to &quot;sustainable levels,&quot; reducing spending on government operations, and spurring home construction through public-private cooperation (via the creation of new federal body Build Canada Homes) and investments in the skilled trades.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carney said Canada &quot;faces a series of crises,&quot; while the global trading system - a source of the country's prosperity for decades - undergoes the &quot;biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
He blamed &quot;longstanding weak productivity&quot; for &quot;straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;The new federal government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing,&quot; Carney writes.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;We must redefine Canada's international, commercial, and security relationships. In the process, we need to develop a defence industrial policy that secures Canada, fulfills our responsibilities to our allies, and helps build our economy.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Carlene Variyan, a former chief of staff in the Trudeau government, said Carney's mandate letter was a &quot;very effective way&quot; of signalling that this new cabinet has &quot;a narrow and disciplined focus in a time of perceived crisis.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;A lot of people who have served in government and were involved in the drafting of mandate letters probably thought yesterday 'why didn't I think of that?' It's quite clever,&quot; she told iPolitics.&#xD;
&#xD;
Variyan, an associate vice-president with Summa Strategies, also said the streamlined focus of the mandate letter contrasts sharply with the 73-member strong shadow cabinet and leadership team unveiled by the Conservatives on Wednesday. Carney's cabinet, unveiled last week, boasts 29 cabinet ministers and 10 secretaries of state.&#xD;
&#xD;
Erin Morrison, who previously served as Jagmeet Singh's director of communications, said the mandate letter provides an opportunity for the hobbled NDP, which took only 7 seats in the April 28 vote, losing official party status.&#xD;
&#xD;
She said Carney's priorities &quot;make it clear that this is a Liberal Party that's moving quite a bit to the right,&quot; pointing to his calls to reduce spending and using private-public partnerships to support new housing construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;[This is] further right than than we ever seen the Liberal Party. Among his seven priorities, he's got cuts and the P3 (public-private partnership) form of privatization, the things that really are at the core of of the NDP working with the labor movement and the progressive movements in Canada,&quot; said Morrison, principal of Morrison Comms and acting vice president of Texture Communications.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;I do not think Canadians will be immediately insulted or upset by Carney's priority list, but I do think the NDP will read it with the insight it needs, and then start picking it apart.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Morrison said she expects the NDP to &quot;punch above its weight&quot; in the next session of Parliament, providing a counter-weight to Carney's policies that appear to be similar to those advanced by the Conservatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
She credited interim leader Don Davies as &quot;super smart&quot; and a &quot;powerful speaker,&quot; and anticipated that the party will emerge with a &quot;unified plan and vision,&quot; compared to the &quot;adrift&quot; Conservative caucus that seems to be debating its future direction after struggling to contrast against the more centre-right Carney during the campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;They're not clear on what they're criticizing anymore because the Liberals match all their policies. They agree on everything. So, you know, what is there to ask about in question period? Who can axe the tax faster? I think they're now at a loss.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Variyan said it's unfair to label Carney as leading a centre-right government, pointing to campaign pledges to protect programs like pharmacare and dentalcare, and invest in universal child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;Those are very much commitments reflective of a progressive party that wants to form a progressive government. There is nothing in the language of that mandate letter that excludes progressive action to do things like broaden the social safety net. Nothing in that mandate letter that blocks further steps toward embracing an energy transition or reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,&quot; she said.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;This very streamlined, singular mandate letter is going to be met with some surprise and some trepidation from stakeholders of government because it's not the way that we're used to doing things. Over the past 10 years, it's become a very useful tool for holding ministers accountable to the things that they were assigned to do, and holding governments accountable. We're not used to having a prime minister set out such a streamlined list of priorities, but it will not fundamentally change the government's approach to implementing the platform that it was elected on.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Conservative strategist Kate Harrison said while the mandate letter does touch upon some Conservative demands, how the Liberals address these concerns will open up opportunities for the Tories.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;You know [Conservative Leader] Pierre Poilievre invited the prime minister to steal his ideas, and it appears that's happening to some extent in terms of the areas of focus [in the mandate letter],&quot; she said.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;I think that the issue will be all about implementation. So, there's talk in the mandate letter about the importance of housing. Well, Conservatives would dispute that more government built housing is the way that you improve affordability. A new agency to deal with this, is that what we need, or is it more removal of red tape? So I think that there will be room to quibble with the how some of these things are done.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Harrison, a vice-chair at Summa, acknowledged that Carney's streamlined mandate latter could help &quot;cabinet stay stay focused and keep their eye on the prize,&quot; saying the former Trudeau front bench struggled because they had &quot;arguably too many priorities&quot; and were &quot;spread too thin&quot; to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
But she said the Liberals missed an opportunity to hog the spotlight and take advantage of the Poilievre being absent from the Commons by slow-walking the start of their term, highlighted by the refusal to bring in a budget this spring.&#xD;
&#xD;
&quot;These are really key opportunities for the Opposition to kind of show how they would be different and how they would do things differently. But, the government doesn't seem to be in a rush to want to prioritize those those things. And so I'm not sure that the Conservatives and Poilievre are missing much of an opportunity, at least in the in terms of the next few months.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mandate letter priorities&#xD;
1. Establishing a new economic and security relationship with the United States and strengthening our collaboration with reliable trading partners and allies around the world.&#xD;
2. Building one Canadian economy by removing barriers to interprovincial trade and identifying and expediting nation-building projects that will connect and transform our country.&#xD;
3. Bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them to get ahead.&#xD;
4. Making housing more affordable by unleashing the power of public-private cooperation, catalysing a modern housing industry, and creating new careers in the skilled trades.&#xD;
5. Protecting Canadian sovereignty and keeping Canadians safe by strengthening the Canadian Armed Forces, securing our borders, and reinforcing law enforcement.&#xD;
6. Attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.&#xD;
7. Spending less on government operations so that Canadians can invest more in the people and businesses that will build the strongest economy in the G7.&#xD;

      <documentation>Building new relationships with the United States and the world&#xD;
The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government is working to strengthen its relationships with reliable trading partners and allies around the world, recognizing that Canada has what the world needs and the values the world respects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada is ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries that share its values, that believe in international co-operation and the free and open exchange of goods, services, and ideas. In this new, fast-evolving world, Canada is ready to lead. This will be demonstrated in June, when Canada convenes the G7 Summit.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a more affordable Canada" id="id-617a9f0e419d43ecad2c81812ac2be5f">
      <documentation>Building a more affordable Canada&#xD;
The Government is guided by its conviction that the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone. Many Canadians are struggling to get ahead. The Government is responding, reducing middle-class taxes and saving two-income families up to $840 a year. It will cut the GST on homes at or under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, delivering savings of up to $50,000. And it will lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect the programs that are already saving families thousands of dollars every year. These include child care and pharmacare. In addition to these, the Government has recently expanded the Canadian Dental Care Plan to cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year.</documentation>

    <element xsi:type="archimate:Goal" name="Building a stronger Canada" id="id-3b39161d3aa04407a1eb981026fba674">
      <documentation>Building a stronger Canada&#xD;
The Government’s overarching goal – its core mission – is to build the strongest economy in the G7. That starts with creating one Canadian economy out of thirteen. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year. The Government will introduce legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility by Canada Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Numerous premiers have already taken vital steps to break down provincial and territorial barriers to trade. Together, we will build on that progress to deliver free trade across the nation by Canada Day. This is critical to unlocking Canada’s full economic potential, but it’s not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build Canada strong, the Government is working closely with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples to identify and catalyse projects of national significance. Projects that will connect Canada, that will deepen Canada’s ties with the world, and that will create high-paying jobs for generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Given the pace of change and the scale of opportunities, speed is of the essence. Through the creation of a new Major Federal Project Office, the time needed to approve a project will be reduced from five years to two; all while upholding Canada’s world-leading environmental standards and its constitutional obligations to Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also strike co-operation agreements with every interested province and territory within six months to realize its goal of “one project, one review.”&#xD;
&#xD;
When Canadians come together, Canada builds things that last.&#xD;
&#xD;
By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don’t just survive ongoing trade wars, but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world’s leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change. To build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the skilled trades. And to build Canada into the world’s leading hub for science and innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Critically, the Government will undertake a series of measures to help double the rate of home building while creating an entirely new housing industry – using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, and Canadian lumber. The Government will introduce measures to deliver affordable homes by creating Build Canada Homes. This mission-driven organization will act to accelerate the development of new affordable housing. It will invest in the growth of the prefabricated and modular housing industry. And it will provide significant financing to affordable home builders. The Government will make the housing market work better, including by cutting municipal development charges in half for all multi-unit housing. The Government will drive supply up to bring housing costs down.</documentation>

      <documentation>Building a safer and more secure Canada &#xD;
To be truly strong, Canada must be secure. To that end, the Government will introduce legislation to enhance security at Canada’s borders. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will have new tools to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors. The Canada Border Services Agency will be given new powers to examine goods destined for export, to prevent the transport of illegal and stolen products, including cars.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect Canada’s sovereignty by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will boost Canada’s defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada’s European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad. To keep communities safe, the Government will hire 1,000 more RCMP personnel. It will change firearms licensing and strengthen enforcement of yellow and red flag laws. Weapons licences for those convicted of intimate partner violence and those subject to protection orders will be revoked. Through the deployment of scanners, drones and helicopters, additional personnel, and K-9 teams, the Government will stem the tide of illegal guns and drugs across the border.&#xD;
&#xD;
It will take these steps while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners and Indigenous Peoples’ longstanding hunting traditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will bring a renewed focus on car theft and home invasions by toughening the Criminal Code to make bail harder to get for repeat offenders charged with committing these crimes, along with human trafficking and drug smuggling.</documentation>

      <documentation>Building a united Canada&#xD;
During this time of great change, Canadians are uniting behind what makes Canada unique.&#xD;
&#xD;
The French language and the Quebec culture are at the heart of the Canadian identity. They define the country that Canadians and I love so much. Canada is a country that respects and celebrates its official languages and Indigenous languages. The Government is determined to protect the institutions that bring these cultures and this identity to the world, like CBC/Radio-Canada. It will protect the people who give us access to fresh, healthy, and quality food: agricultural producers. And it will protect supply management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nature is core to Canada’s identity. In 2022, Canada convened COP15 in Montréal, which concluded with 196 countries striking a historic agreement to protect 30 percent of their lands and 30 percent of waters by 2030. To this end, the Government will protect more of Canada’s nature than ever before through the creation of new national parks, national urban parks, marine protected areas, and other conservation initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will always protect the rights and freedoms that the Charter guarantees for every Canadian.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will be a reliable partner to Indigenous Peoples, upholding its fundamental commitment to advancing reconciliation. Central to this commitment is the creation of long-term wealth and prosperity with Indigenous Peoples. For that reason, the Government will double the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program from $5 billion to $10 billion – enabling more Indigenous communities to become owners of major projects. As Canada moves forward with nation-building projects, the Government will always be firmly guided by the principle of free, prior, and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s immigration system has long been a source of pride for Canadians and of dynamism for the economy. The Government is dedicated to rebuilding the trust of Canadians in immigration by restoring balance to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will cap the total number of temporary foreign workers and international students to less than five percent of Canada’s population by 2027. By doing this, the Government will attract the best talent in the world to build our economy, while sending a clear message to Canadians working abroad that there is no better time to come home.</documentation>

      <documentation>Building Canada Strong by spending less and investing more&#xD;
In all of its actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can invest more.&#xD;
&#xD;
Day-to-day government spending – the government’s operating budget – has been growing by nine percent every year. The Government will introduce measures to bring it below two percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Transfers to provinces, territories, or individuals will be maintained. The Government will balance its operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication, and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government will take a series of measures to catalyse new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. The scale of the Government’s initiative will match the challenges of our times and the ambitions of Canadians.</documentation>

      <documentation>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians. The Department collects, manages, and uses vast amounts of data every day—in everything from service delivery to policy and program development. Equipping the right people with the right insights to make the right decisions at the right time across the Department is key to better understanding our clients and how we make a difference in Canadians’ lives from coast to coast to coast. At the same time, it ensures that we get the most value from data while mitigating risks to Canadians. &#xD;
&#xD;
The objective of the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is to bring ESDC further along the path towards achieving better services and outcomes for all Canadians. The Strategy aims to empower departmental employees to collectively treat data as enterprise assets, grounded in a culture of data stewardship and collaboration, that spans across policy analysis and research throughto evaluation and reporting back to Canadians. It outlines enterprise direction for equipping employees with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to deliver on the organizational mandate. It also supports us in strengthening our ability to monitor our programs, enhance operational efficiencies and leverage and adapt to changing technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).&#xD;
&#xD;
Progress made in implementing the 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy will also support ESDC’s first AI Strategy, as well as the advancement of the Government of Canada’s 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service and establishment of Canada’s first AI Strategy. On all of these fronts, our effortswill be rooted in a human-centric approach based on human rights, transparency, openness, and respect for the protection of personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the core of creating a seamless client service experience and generating value for Canadians is the ability to manage, find, understand, trust, share and use data as corporate and strategic assets. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy is centered on four key Service Areas – Data Innovation, Data Governance and Trust, Data Culture and Literacy, and Foundational Data Infrastructure. Focusing on these Service Areas will enable the Department toidentify and manage opportunities and risks, while helping us to implement improvements that allow for the scaling of advanced data and analytical methods. &#xD;
&#xD;
The world is changing rapidly, the status quo is no longer adequate, and ESDC must be agile to meet these challenges head on. The 2023-2026 ESDC Data Strategy lays down the foundation for the future of datadriven work at ESDC. The Strategy is designed to evolve as new opportunities and priorities arise. As technologies and advanced methods evolve, the Strategy positions us to continue to execute on our commitment to the responsible and innovative use of data to realize wide-ranging benefits across the Department. It also sets the direction on how we continue to leverage data efficiently to drive key initiatives that improve programs and service delivery, to support modernization and transformation initiatives, and to measure our impact and results on the lives of Canadians.</documentation>

      <documentation>Data Governance and Trust are key concepts for the foundation of sustainable data management. Canadians entrust the Government of Canada and ESDC with their data. They expect that it will be used responsibly and kept secure. Data Governance is about creating a system of decision rights and accountabilities for data that are executed according to agreed-upon models.&#xD;
&#xD;
 The trust of the Canadian public is not a given, and it is up to ESDC and other federal government organizations to foster public trust in how the Government of Canada uses their data. Data Governance describeswho can take what actions with what data, under what circumstances, and using what methods. It is also about being open with the public about these processes to improve public trust in Government.</documentation>

      <documentation>For a large organization like ESDC, a one-size-fits-all approach to data governance might not be realistic. The data governance program follows an adaptive approach that recognizes that data governance practices exist across the organization. It allows the flexibility to apply different governance approaches to specific business scenarios while providing enterprise guidance and standards. For example, employ inga top-down approach to data governance when implementing new activities, such as the ESDC Data Accountability Framework, or employing a bottom-up approach through the outputs of working-level groups such as the Enterprise Dat Stewardship Network.</documentation>

      <documentation>All the work across ESDC to turn data into knowledge and deeper insights that inform decision-making is made possible by the underlying Foundational Data Infrastructure. The infrastructure allows the secure collection, storage, transformation, integration, use, and sharing of data assets. Foundational Data Infrastructure helps meet the organization’s need for data access by using up-to-date platforms, software, and common tools to collect, organize, store, manage, and use data. Resources are required to establish scalable data foundations within ESDC so that these foundations can be leveraged to support data innovation, help generate a complete picture of the client and their needs, and to provide seamless client service.&#xD;

      <documentation>Strengthening Canada’s social safety net&#xD;
Nobody should be left behind in this country. Service Canada’s role is critical in breaking down barriers and building economic opportunity for all. That is why, as we’re navigating the serious consequences of the trade war with one of our most important trade partners, Employment Insurance (EI) remains a cornerstone of Canada’s social safety net, supporting workers through job loss, parental leave, illness and caregiving responsibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Renforcer le filet de sécurité sociale du Canada&#xD;
Personne ne devrait être laissé pour compte dans notre pays. Service Canada joue un rôle essentiel pour éliminer les obstacles et créer des possibilités économiques pour tous. C’est pourquoi, à un moment où faisons face aux graves conséquences de la guerre commerciale avec l’un de nos plus importants partenaires commerciaux, l’assurance-emploi demeure la pierre angulaire du filet de sécurité sociale du Canada en soutenant les travailleurs lorsque survient une perte d’emploi, un congé parental ou une maladie ou lorsqu’ils doivent assumer des responsabilités d’aidant naturel.</documentation>

      <documentation>Expanding access to essential programs&#xD;
Service Canada continues to broaden access to vital programs that support Canadians’ health and financial well-being. The launch of the Canadian Dental Care Plan has opened the door to affordable dental care for eligible individuals across the country. More recently, Service Canada began processing applications for the Canada Disability Benefit, delivering direct financial support to persons with disabilities.&#xD;
This work goes beyond fairness—it’s about creating meaningful change, empowering individuals, and helping Canadians build a stronger future by unlocking their full potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
Élargir l’accès aux programmes essentiels&#xD;
Service Canada continue d’élargir l’accès à des programmes essentiels qui favorisent la santé et le bien-être financier des Canadiens. Le lancement du Régime canadien de soins dentaires a ouvert la voie à des soins dentaires abordables aux personnes admissibles à travers le pays. Plus récemment, Service Canada a amorcé le traitement des demandes pour la Prestation canadienne pour les personnes handicapées, qui offre du soutien financier direct aux personnes en situation de handicap. &#xD;
Ce travail va au-delà de l’équité, il s’agit de créer un véritable changement, de favoriser l’autonomie des individus et d’aider les Canadiens à bâtir un avenir plus solide en leur permettant de s’épanouir pleinement.</documentation>

      <documentation>Modernizing and improving service delivery&#xD;
As Canadians’ needs continue to evolve, Service Canada has expanded its offerings to provide more accessible and responsive support. One key advancement has been the enhancement of self-serve tools for Old Age Security (OAS) clients. Today, more than 7.4 million Canadians can apply for OAS benefits online, update personal information, upload documents and access or download their tax slips—all through a streamlined digital service. &#xD;
&#xD;
Moderniser et améliorer la prestation des services&#xD;
À mesure que les besoins des Canadiens évoluent, Service Canada a élargi son offre afin de fournir du soutien plus accessible et plus réactif. L’une des principales avancées a été l’amélioration des outils libre-service pour les clients de la Sécurité de la vieillesse (SV). Aujourd’hui, plus de 7,4 millions de Canadiens peuvent demander des prestations de la SV en ligne, mettre à jour leurs renseignements personnels, télécharger des documents et accéder à leurs relevés fiscaux ou les télécharger, le tout grâce à un service numérique simplifié. </documentation>

      <documentation>Several features have been cut to reduce the overall time and funding required to complete the project, such as the custom-built data intake portal, which was originally scoped to allow data entries directly from service providers. This was the costliest element of the Deferred DCS plan, and cutting it trims the project cost down significantly. ESDC does not need to position the Strategy to  receive data directly from external to government sources at this stage, therefore we do not need the higher levels of security (and the higher associated cost).</documentation>

&#xD;
Advanced business intelligence module for the YESS Policy Division would  allow better insights from performance measurement data to inform decision making and more robust policy analysis/development. This feature would entail the ability to analyze and manipulate the imported participant level data. Out of scope because of time and resource limitations for this project. As long as ESDC has access to disaggregated data, the department can pursue analytics solutions like PowerBI at a later time.</documentation>

Business architecture is a critical aspect for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. The architectural strategy advocates whole‑of‑government approach where IT is aligned to business services and solutions are based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities in order to deliver a cohesive user experience. As such, it is essential that business services, stakeholder needs, opportunities to improve cohesion and opportunities for reuse across government be clearly understood. In the past these elements have not been a priority. It is expected that the IT culture and practices will have to change to make business architecture, in general, and these elements a primary focus.</documentation>

&#xD;
Information architecture includes both structured and unstructured data. The best practices and principles aim to support the needs of a business service and business capability orientation. To facilitate effective sharing of data and information across government, information architectures should be designed to reflect a consistent approach to data, such as the adoption of federal and international standards. Information architecture should also reflect responsible data management, information management and governance practices, including the source, quality, interoperability, and associated legal and policy obligations related to the data assets. Information architectures should also distinguish between personal and non‑personal data and information as the collection, use, sharing (disclosure), and management of personal information must respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and its related policies.</documentation>

Application architecture practices must evolve significantly for the successful implementation of the GC Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture. Transitioning from legacy systems based on monolithic architectures to architectures that oriented around business services and based on re‑useable components implementing business capabilities, is a major shift. Interoperability becomes a key element, and the number of stakeholders that must be considered increases.</documentation>

Enterprise Architecture Framework&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework is the criteria used by the Government of Canada enterprise architecture review board and departmental architecture review boards when reviewing digital initiatives to ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures across business, information, application, technology and security domains to support strategic outcomes. The EA Framework came into effect on December 1, 2020 and is a replacement of Appendix A, Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment from the Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework provide details on the requirements set out in the following sections of the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.3 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Prescribing expectations with regard to enterprise architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.2.4 of the Policy on Service and Digital. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Canada is responsible for: Establishing and chairing an enterprise architecture review board that is mandated to define current and target architecture standards for the Government of Canada and review departmental proposals for alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.1.1.1 of the Directive on Service and Digital. The departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for: Chairing a departmental architecture review board that is mandated to review and approve the architecture of all departmental digital initiatives and ensure their alignment with enterprise architectures.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Enterprise Architecture Framework will be published on Canada.ca. Until then here is the EA Framework.</documentation>

      <documentation>KEY FINDINGS&#xD;
Overall, the audit found that:&#xD;
     There were weaknesses in departments’ controls for preventing, detecting, and responding to cloud cyberattacks.&#xD;
     The roles and responsibilities for ensuring cloud cybersecurity were unclear.&#xD;
     TBS did not provide departments with a costing model or funding approach for cloud serves.&#xD;
     PSPC and SSC did not include environmental criteria in their procurement of cloud services.&#xD;
The OAG report did not state that personal data stored in the cloud has been compromised or that security breaches had occurred.</documentation>

      <documentation>Highlights of our RECOMMENDATIONS&#xD;
 - In consultation with Shared Services Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should clarify who is responsible for the initial validation and ongoing monitoring of cloud guardrail controls.&#xD;
 - The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should ensure that the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan applies to the evolving cloud environment and shared responsibilities, review and test it at least annually, and update it as needed.&#xD;
 - In consultation with Shared Services Canada and other departments, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat should develop and provide a costing model to help departments make informed decisions about moving to the cloud and Help departments determine their long-term operational funding needs.</documentation>

      <documentation>Why we did this audit&#xD;
&#xD;
Information stored digitally, whether on‑premises in data centres or in the cloud, is exposed to risks of being compromised.&#xD;
Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians’ personal information. Departments must work together to protect this information from a number of risks, including cyberattacks.&#xD;
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise, and strong controls to prevent, detect, and respond to them can reduce the risk of breaches.</documentation>

      <documentation>Canada faces a series of crises. In a more dangerous and divided world, geopolitical risks are rising, threatening our sovereignty. The global trading system – which has helped power Canada’s prosperity for decades – is undergoing the biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall. At home, our longstanding weak productivity is straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely.&#xD;
&#xD;
The new federal Government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing.</documentation>

      <documentation>OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
The Strategy is designed to enable the following results: &#xD;
• Integrated data that enables horizontal lines of sight across our policies, programs, services and channels, resulting in Canadians getting the benefits they are entitled to and ensuring no one is left behind.&#xD;
• The right controls, secure environments and proper data management and governance practices to effectively manage privacy and access, reduce data risk, and ultimately increase citizen trust.&#xD;
• Accelerated use of automation to improve administrative efficiencies and meet or exceed service standards. This is accomplished by considering data up front, using modern data tools, and managing work so that employees can focus on more complex and high priority cases and better serve vulnerable clients. &#xD;
• A culture of transparency that is fostered through open data that drives integrated policies and services, while embedding the sharing of insights, concerns, and best practices in the Department’s culture.&#xD;
• Contextualized data that is fit-for-purpose, timely, discoverable, and properly documented. This enables its timely use to enhance operational efficiency, policy, analysis, research, and evaluation. &#xD;
• Trusted information that is readily accessible and helps senior leaders make timely, data-driven decisions to promptly address emerging priorities and implement service improvements.&#xD;
• Empowered employees with the skills and tools to manage and use data and analytics innovatively, ethically, and responsibly to carry out their work.</documentation>

      <documentation>ESDC’s Data Strategy’s vision is to deliver better outcomes and services for all Canadians by empowering departmental employees to treat data as enterprise assets— shared, protected resources grounded in a culture of data stewardship and collaboration. This will happen in phases as the Department increases its data maturity step-by-step, building on skills and capabilities developed as the Strategy is implemented. In advancing data maturity, the Strategy addresses different challenges faced by the Department, such as data silos and outdated tools and systems, by advancing work under four Service Areas. The implementation of ESDC’s Data Strategy moves us further and further ahead in having access to the right data at the right time and enabling timely decision-making and responsiveness to emerging challenges. It facilitates cross-departmental collaboration, drives innovation, and advances efficient problem-solving by enabling people across the Department to leverage diverse data sets and put ESDC’s data analytics capabilities into action.</documentation>

&#xD;
Building a resilient economy: a cleaner &amp; healthier future for our kids&#xD;
&#xD;
Speech from the Throne to open the First Session of the Forty-Fourth Parliament of Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
Congratulations to each of you and welcome to all the new Parliamentarians who will together with their colleagues make their mark on Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.&#xD;
&#xD;
This land acknowledgement is not a symbolic declaration. It is our true history. In each of your own ridings, I encourage you to seek out the truth, and to learn about the lived realities in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. Although each community is distinct, we all share a desire to chart a way forward together towards reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The discovery of unmarked graves of children who died in the residential school system shows how the actions of governments and institutions of the past have devastated Indigenous Peoples and continue to impact them today. We cannot hide from these discoveries; they open deep wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
Despite the profound pain, there is hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is hope in the every day. Reconciliation is not a single act, nor does it have an end date. It is a lifelong journey of healing, respect and understanding. We need to embrace the diversity of Canada and demonstrate respect and understanding for all peoples every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, I have seen how Canadians are committed to reconciliation. Indigenous Peoples are reclaiming our history, stories, culture and language through action. Non-Indigenous Peoples are coming to understand and accept the true impact of the past and the pain suffered by generations of Indigenous Peoples. Together they are walking the path towards reconciliation. &#xD;
&#xD;
We must turn the guilt we carry into action.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on our collective health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
Action on climate change.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our Earth is in danger. From a warming Arctic to the increasing devastation of natural disasters, our land and our people need help. We must move talk into action and adapt where we must. We cannot afford to wait.&#xD;
&#xD;
From the grief and pain of residential schools to the fear of threats to our natural environment to the profound impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this past year has been hard on all of us.&#xD;
&#xD;
I want to thank all workers across Canada, especially those in health care, for their efforts to keep us safe and healthy, and offer my deepest condolences to those who have experienced loss of loved ones during the pandemic. It has touched us all, including those in this chamber who lost a cherished colleague just a few days ago, Senator Forest-Niesing.  To her family and to all of you, my deepest sympathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
The pandemic has shown us that we need to put a focus on mental health in the same way as physical well-being because they are inseparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
As you begin this 44th Parliament of Canada, and as we recover from the effects of the pandemic and build a better relationship between Indigenous Peoples and non-Indigenous Peoples, I urge you to transform discussion into concrete results for us and for our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Collaborate with and listen to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
Listen to the diverse voices who speak a multitude of languages and who shape this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Confronting the hard questions will not always be easy or comfortable—and it will require conviction—but it is necessary. The outcome will be a sustainable, united Canada, for you, for me, for our children, and for every generation to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
Opening&#xD;
As we speak, British Columbians are facing immeasurable challenges as their homes, their communities, and their well-being are impacted by terrible flooding.&#xD;
&#xD;
But in a time of crisis, we know how Canadians respond. We step up and we are there for each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
And the Government will continue to be there for the people of British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
In 2020, Canadians did not know they would face the crisis of a once-in-a-century pandemic. But, as always, no one should be surprised by how Canadians responded.&#xD;
&#xD;
We adapted. We helped one another. And we stayed true to our values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Values like compassion, courage, and determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Values like democracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
And in this difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Their direction is clear: not only do they want Parliamentarians to work together to put this pandemic behind us, they also want bold, concrete solutions to meet the other challenges we face.&#xD;
&#xD;
Growing an economy that works for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fighting climate change.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Moving forward on the path of reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Making sure our communities are safe, healthy, and inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, the decade got off to an incredibly difficult start, but this is the time to rebuild.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment for Parliamentarians to work together to get big things done, and shape a better future for our kids.   &#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to build a healthier today and tomorrow&#xD;
Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Already, the Government has mandated vaccination for federal and federally-regulated workers, and for everyone travelling within Canada by plane, train, or ship. It has also ensured a standardized Canadian proof of vaccination for domestic and international use.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is securing next generation COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and doses for kids from 5 to 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
And around the world, Canada will continue working with its partners to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines and other resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build a healthy future, we must also strengthen our healthcare system and public health supports for all Canadians, especially seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities, and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is work to be done. On accessibility. On care in rural communities. On delayed procedures. On mental health and addiction treatment. On long-term care. On improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions and get the best possible results.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will work collaboratively with provinces, territories, and other partners to deliver real results on what Canadians need.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to grow a more resilient economy&#xD;
The best thing we can do for the economy remains ending the pandemic for good. But as we do, we should rebuild an economy that works for everyone. At the height of the lockdowns, the Government made historic, necessary investments so families could keep paying the rent and small businesses could stay afloat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, with one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, and employment back to pre-pandemic levels, the Government is moving to more targeted support, while prudently managing spending.&#xD;
&#xD;
To ensure no one is left behind, support will be extended or added for industries that continue to struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the same time, the Government will also continue making life more affordable for all Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inflation is a challenge that countries around the world are facing. And while Canada’s economic performance is better than many of our partners, we must keep tackling the rising cost of living. To do that, the Government’s plan includes two major priorities: housing and child care.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whether it is building more units per year, increasing affordable housing, or ending chronic homelessness, the Government is committed to working with its partners to get real results.  &#xD;
&#xD;
For example, the Housing Accelerator Fund will help municipalities build more and better, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also help families buy their first home sooner with a more flexible First-Time Home Buyer’s Incentive, a new Rent-to-Own program, and by reducing the closing costs for first-time buyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Supporting families will make life more affordable for the middle class and people working hard to join it.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Canada Child Benefit has already helped lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and will continue increasing to keep up with the cost of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue building the first-ever Canada-wide early learning and child care system. By the end of 2022, average fees for regulated child care will be cut in half in most of the provinces and territories. And in some places, this will even happen as early as the start of the year. Families will save thousands of dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
Four jurisdictions have not yet reached agreements on child care. Two are territories with unique infrastructure challenges, and the Government will keep working together to ensure we meet the needs of the North. The Government will continue working with the remaining two provinces to finalize agreements that will deliver $10-a-day child care for families who so badly need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in affordable child care – just like housing – is not just good for families. It helps grow the entire economy. And so does immigration.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will continue increasing immigration levels and reducing wait times, while supporting family reunification and delivering a world-leading refugee resettlement program.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment for bolder climate action&#xD;
Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries – we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.  &#xD;
&#xD;
As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world’s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.   &#xD;
&#xD;
As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.&#xD;
&#xD;
Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians’ pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada’s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to fight harder for safer communities&#xD;
While we address climate change –&#xD;
&#xD;
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences –&#xD;
&#xD;
While we grow our economy for everyone –&#xD;
&#xD;
We cannot turn away from other challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.&#xD;
&#xD;
During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone should be – and feel – safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will continue combatting hate and racism, including with a renewed Anti-Racism Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to stand up for diversity and inclusion&#xD;
Canadians understand that equity, justice, and diversity are the means and the ends to living together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fighting systemic racism, sexism, discrimination, misconduct, and abuse, including in our core institutions, will remain a key priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also continue to reform the criminal justice system and policing.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to rebuild for everyone. The Government will continue to invest in the empowerment of Black and racialized Canadians, and Indigenous Peoples. It will also continue to fight harmful content online, and stand up for LGBTQ2 communities while completing the ban on conversion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Canadians, our two official languages are part of who we are.  &#xD;
&#xD;
It is essential to support official language minority communities, and to protect and promote French outside and inside Quebec.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will reintroduce the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English and the Strengthening of the Official Languages Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support Canadian culture and creative industries, the Government will also reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act and ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to move faster on the path to reconciliation&#xD;
This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth. As the Government continues to respond to the Calls to Action, it will invest in that truth, including with the creation of a national monument to honour survivors, and with the appointment of a Special Interlocutor to further advance justice on residential schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
To support communities, the Government will also invest significantly in a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy, guided by Indigenous Peoples, survivors, and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone in our country deserves to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is why the Government will accelerate work with Indigenous partners to address the national tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also make sure communities have the support they need to keep families together, while ensuring fair and equitable compensation for those harmed by the First Nations Child and Family Services program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Reconciliation requires a whole-of-government approach, breaking down barriers, and rethinking how to accelerate our work. Whether it is eliminating all remaining long-term drinking water advisories or implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Government is committed to closing the gaps that far too many First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities still face today.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the moment to fight for a secure, just, and equitable world&#xD;
The last 19 months have underscored that we live in a deeply interconnected world.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada must stand up on the pressing challenges of our time, through our own commitments and by increasing our engagement with international partners, coalitions, and organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the face of rising authoritarianism and great power competition, Canada must reinforce international peace and security, the rule of law, democracy, and respect for human rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s prosperity – and middle class jobs – depend on preserving and expanding open, rules-based trade and ensuring our supply chains are strong and resilient.&#xD;
&#xD;
At home, the Government will continue to protect Canadians from threats to our communities, our society, and our democracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
A changing world requires adapting and expanding diplomatic engagement. Canada will continue working with key allies and partners, while making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and across the Arctic.&#xD;
&#xD;
Increasing Canada’s foreign assistance budget each year, and investing in sustainable, equitable, and feminist development that benefits the world’s most vulnerable and promotes gender equality will continue to be priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
We will always stand up for a brighter future for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
This decade is still young. With compassion, courage, and determination, we have the power to make it better than how it started.&#xD;
&#xD;
But that can only happen by standing together.&#xD;
&#xD;
Parliamentarians, never before has so much depended on your ability to deliver results for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
That is what people expect and need from you.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition to ending this pandemic, their priorities for this 44th Parliament are clear: a more resilient economy, and a cleaner and healthier future for all of our kids.&#xD;
&#xD;
I do not doubt that you will honour the trust that has been placed in you.&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons, may you be equal to the profound trust bestowed on you by Canadians, and may Divine Providence guide you in all your duties.&#xD;

To: DGIIT Employés / Employees IITB (EDSC/ESDC)&#xD;
Subject: FW: Changements à la haute direction de la DGIIT / IITB Senior Leadership Changes&#xD;
&#xD;
Bonjour à tous,&#xD;
&#xD;
À la suite des annonces d'aujourd'hui de la haute direction envoyées par nos sous-ministres (ci-joint), j'aimerais vous fournir du contexte et des renseignements supplémentaires sur ce que l'ajout de deux nouveaux sous-ministres adjoints signifie pour nous tous à la DGIIT, pour le reste de notre ministère et à la communauté numérique élargie du gouvernement du Canada (GC).&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout d'abord, permettez-moi de féliciter Rina Lorello et Nasser Alsukayri pour leurs nominations à venir à leurs nouveaux postes au sein de la DGIIT. Comme annoncé, Rina sera nommée sous-ministre adjointe et dirigeante principale de l'information déléguée (DPID) et Nasser sera nommé sous-ministre adjoint, Responsable du changement technique (Programme de modernisation du versement des prestations) et dirigeant principal de l'information délégué.&#xD;
&#xD;
C'est une excellente nouvelle pour nous tous. Ces nominations reconnaissent plusieurs choses.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	EDSC subit actuellement une transformation massive de ses services, comme vous le savez. Le rôle de la DGIIT dans ce travail est suffisamment important – nous devons nous assurer que tous les éléments informatiques substantiels de notre transformation sont livrés, que ce soit par notre équipe ou par nos partenaires de prestation de services. Ce travail est de la plus haute priorité pour notre ministère, pour le GC et, en fait, pour les Canadiens.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	La plus grande initiative de notre transformation est la Modernisation du versement des prestations (MVP). Les sous-ministres ont souligné le rôle important que la DGIIT joue dans la MVP à de nombreuses reprises, y compris l'annonce en 2020 de mon rôle - désormais assumé par Nasser - en tant que Responsable du changement technique dans le programme de la MVP, avec des responsabilités spécifiques envers le Dirigeant principal de la transformation. Le travail informatique dans la MVP est un mandat complet en soi, et il prendra bientôt de l'ampleur à mesure que nous commencerons la mise en œuvre de la Sécurité de la vieillesse dans la MVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Alors que notre ministère et notre direction générale sont occupés à la transformation, la DGIIT a également la très grande tâche de continuer à faire fonctionner et à maintenir les services informatiques essentiels qui sous-tendent tout. EDSC est souvent qualifié de « portefeuille » et non seulement de ministère, pour une très bonne raison : nous sommes énormes. Nos opérations informatiques sont relativement importantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Nos programmes et services, ainsi que les systèmes informatiques qui les exécutent, ne sont pas statiques – il y a des changements tout le temps. EDSC a un portefeuille d'environ 50 grands projets actuellement en cours et de nombreux petits projets. Presque tout ce travail implique la DGIIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Enfin, la taille, la stature, l'importance d'EDSC et le très bon travail que nous faisons font de nous un chef de file dans la communauté numérique du GC. Nous pouvons faire plus dans notre communauté élargie pour partager nos réussites, nos pratiques exemplaires et nos leçons avec les autres.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tout compte fait, à la DGIIT, collectivement, nous avons l'un des mandats informatiques les plus visibles, les plus difficiles et les plus importants du pays. Rina et Nasser apportent tous deux un leadership supplémentaire et diversifié à notre direction générale pour nous aider dans notre important travail.&#xD;
&#xD;
De votre point de vue, en tant qu'employés de la DGIIT, l'ajout de Rina et Nasser dans leurs nouveaux rôles ne changera pas beaucoup votre vie professionnelle quotidienne – il n'y a pas de changement organisationnel en cours ici. La DGIIT continuera comme une seule organisation, avec un DPI pour le ministère. Les deux nouveaux DPID et moi travaillerons ensemble comme une seule équipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bien que le nouveau rôle de Nasser soit noté ici (la DGIIT dans la MVP), Rina, Nasser et moi prendrons les prochaines semaines pour déterminer la responsabilité de toutes les activités et les priorités de la direction générale. Nous partagerons plus d'informations à ce sujet avec vous dès qu'elles seront disponibles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rina, Nasser et moi nous engageons à veiller à ce que les informations soient partagées régulièrement et, plus important encore, en temps opportun. À cette fin, nous prévoyons une rencontre et une discussion ouverte à la mi-juin, pendant ou à proximité de la Semaine nationale de la fonction publique. Les détails de cette rencontre seront transmis dans les prochains jours.&#xD;
&#xD;
Veuillez vous joindre à moi pour féliciter Rina et Nasser pour leurs nominations à venir.&#xD;
&#xD;
Merci,&#xD;

***************************************************&#xD;
&#xD;
Hello Everyone, &#xD;
 &#xD;
Following today’s senior leadership announcements made by our Deputy Ministers (attached), I would like to provide you with some additional context and information about what the addition of two new Assistant Deputy Ministers means to all of us in IITB, to the rest of our Department, and to the broader Government of Canada (GC) digital community.&#xD;
&#xD;
First, let me congratulate Rina Lorello and Nasser Alsukayri for their upcoming appointments to their new positions within IITB. As announced, Rina will be appointed as Assistant Deputy Minister and Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO) and Nasser will be appointed as Assistant Deputy Minister, Technical Change Authority (Benefits Delivery Modernization Programme), and Deputy Chief Information Officer.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is great news for all of us. These appointments recognise several things.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	ESDC is undergoing a massive service transformation right now, as you know.  IITB’s role in this work is suitably large – we must ensure that all of the substantial IT elements of our transformation are delivered, whether by our team or by our service delivery partners.  This work is of highest priority in our Department, and for the GC and indeed for Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The largest initiative in our transformation is Benefits Delivery Modernisation (BDM).  The DMs have signalled the important role that IITB has in BDM on many occasions, including the 2020 announcement of my role – now to be assumed by Nasser – as Technical Change Authority in the BDM programme, with specific accountabilities to the Chief Transformation Officer.  The IT work in BDM is a full mandate of and in itself, and it will soon grow larger as we begin the implementation of Old Age Security in BDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	While our Department and our Branch are busy transforming, IITB also has the very large job of keeping running and maintaining the essential IT services that underpin everything.  ESDC is often referred to as a “portfolio” and not just a department, for very good reason: We are enormous.  Our IT operations are comparably large.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Our programs and services, and the IT systems that run them, are not static – there is change all the time.  ESDC has a portfolio of roughly 50 major projects currently underway, and numerous smaller ones.  Nearly all of this work involves IITB.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Lastly, ESDC’s size, stature, importance, and the very good work that we do makes us a leader in the GC digital community.  There is more that we can do in our broader community to share our successes, best practices, and lessons with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
All to say, in IITB, collectively, we have one of the biggest, most challenging, and most important IT mandates in the country.  Both Rina and Nasser bring additional and diverse leadership to our Branch to help in our important work.&#xD;
&#xD;
From your perspective, as IITB employees, the addition of Rina and Nasser in their new roles here will not change your daily work life much – there is no organisational change happening here.  IITB will continue as one branch, with one CIO for the department.  The two new DCIOs and I will work together as one team.&#xD;
&#xD;
While Nasser’s new role is noted here (IITB in BDM), Rina, Nasser and I will take the next few weeks to determine the responsibility for all of the Branch’s activities and priorities.  We will share more information on this with you as soon as it is available.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Rina, Nasser and I are committed to ensuring that information is shared regularly and, more importantly, in a timely fashion. To that end, we are planning a meet and greet town hall for mid-June, in or near National Public Service Week.  Details on this meeting will be sent in the coming days.&#xD;
&#xD;
Please join me in congratulating Rina and Nasser on their upcoming appointments. &#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you, &#xD;
&#xD;

        <documentation>Caption: National Public Service Week 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
Hello Everyone,&#xD;
  &#xD;
Happy National Public Service Week 2022!  This week is an opportunity for all of us to recognize and celebrate the efforts and leadership of public servants from across the country. &#xD;
&#xD;
At management tables and speaking to employees across the country, we regularly hear positive feedback about your efforts. Many IITB employees are on the front lines of the services ESDC employees use regularly, as well as those upon which Canadians rely. What you do really matters; it keeps ESDC up and running and ensures Canadians get the support they need when they need it. &#xD;
&#xD;
As the Department has grown in recent years, you have stepped up to meet the challenge of increased demand for information technology (IT) and information management (IM) services. Whether that’s by providing the equipment and software employees need to do their jobs remotely or in the office, ensuring our systems and data remain safe, or managing the IM and IT aspects of the many projects we support, you have shown resilience in keeping up with ESDC’s needs throughout the pandemic, while also feeling its effects personally.&#xD;
&#xD;
We are constantly impressed by your dedication and commitment to service. We are proud to be public servants, proud to lead IITB, and proud to work with such a talented and hardworking team. &#xD;
&#xD;
We encourage you to take some time this week and participate in the virtual activities that recognize your efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
We look forward to seeing you and taking your questions at the IITB Town Hall on June 15. Event details are included in a calendar invitation you would have received earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
We encourage you to also attend a live, bilingual, virtual “Ask Me Anything” Deputy Ministers’ Town Hall that will be open to everyone in ESDC on June 16 from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
As we approach summer, we hope that you will take time for yourselves with your loved ones and recharge. Thank you for all that you have done.  &#xD;

PURPOSE&#xD;
The purpose of this presentation is to provide an update and seek feedback on the cloud operationalization framework, including GC Cloud Guardrails v2.0, Public Cloud Roles and Responsibilities, and SOP for Guardrails Validation, Escalation and Oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
BACKGROUND&#xD;
• In August 2019, the Government of Canada (GC) established supply contracts for Protected B Cloud Services with AWS Canada and Microsoft Azure.&#xD;
• For the GC to consume this supply securely and responsibly, the Chief Technology Officer of the GC deemed that an underlying operationalization framework was required.&#xD;
• In September 2019, the GC Cloud Operationalization Framework was approved by GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB). This included the establishment of a set of minimal security controls and architecture prior to departments consuming Pro B supply in the form of GC Cloud Guardrails.&#xD;
• The GC Cloud Guardrails are a set of controls focused on ensuring departments have implemented a minimum set of protections in their cloud environment focused on access management, network perimeter, segmentation, and monitoring. These Guardrails are needed in addition to a security assessment and an Authority To Operate (ATO).&#xD;
• In May 2022, the GC Cloud Guardrails were mandated under the Directive on Service and Digital Appendix G: Standard on Enterprise Information Technology Service Common Configurations.&#xD;
• In November 2022, the Office of the Auditor General’s (OAG) audit Report recommended the GC clarify the process and roles/responsibilities for validating and monitoring Cloud Guardrails and extend these to PSPC procured solutions (see Appendix A for details).&#xD;
• To support the Management Action Plan (the GC’s response), TBS, SSC, and PSPC initiated an activity to update the GC Cloud Guardrails.</documentation>

        <documentation>Executive Summary&#xD;
Following the 2023 budget proposal to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) to provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians, the CDCP will:&#xD;
· provide Canadians the ability to apply and be considered access to the CDCP for their oral heath needs,&#xD;
· seek help and guidance on eligibility, how to apply and information on the program, and&#xD;
· maintain or renew their status throughout the year.&#xD;
This business case details the CDCP business need, business context, background, options analysis, evaluation criteria, and solution scope to deliver the solution project.&#xD;
&#xD;
Business Context Diagram Description&#xD;
Budget 2023 proposes providing $13 billion over five years, starting in 2023-24, and $4.4 billion ongoing, to Health Canada (HC) to implement the new Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP). The CDCP will provide dental coverage for uninsured Canadians with an annual family income of less than $90,000, with no co-pays for those with family incomes under $70,000. &#xD;
It is estimated that approximately 9 million Canadians will be eligible for the CDCP. (Family income &lt;$90k, resident of Canada, no access to a comparable dental insurance plan). The CDCP will be an insurance program delivered via a third-party benefits administrator (TPA). The CDCP will be launched in phases, starting with a targeted eligible population of seniors, people with disabilities, and people under 18 (totaling 4.7M) in 2024. Seniors and persons with disabilities should be prioritized for coverage as of April 1, 2024. In addition, children under 12* must be enrolled and be able to access dental coverage under the Canada Dental Care Plan as of July 1, 2024. (given that the existing interim dental benefit for children under 12 ends July 1, 2024). Full program eligibility for all families within an income less than $90,000 and who do not have access dental care through an employer, pension or private plan will start January 2025. &#xD;
&#xD;
ESDC/Service Canada (SC) is entering in a partnership agreement to deliver services on behalf of HC to Canadians as the plan starts up and on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
HC is the lead for program implementation and works in collaboration with ESDC/Service Canada and partners on this implementation. This business case encompasses the CDCP service delivery implementation project that will deliver the required capabilities to intake CDCP applications, process applications and determine eligibility, communicate the decision to applicants and provide client support in the Service Canada network. The capabilities will support delivery of the following target client experience and flow: &lt;May 4, 2023 Service Delivery Process Flow Diagram (A-to-H)></documentation>

Subject: RE: EMAS: IT continuity&#xD;
&#xD;
Sorry to interject, but there’s an element here I really need to clarify. The upcoming implementation of the departmental Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is *not* a replacement for the Corporate Solution Directory (CSD). They’re two very different things.&#xD;
&#xD;
Over the years since the CSD was introduced as a tool to support APM’s reporting to TBS, it became a de facto CMDB only because of the urgent need for one in the branch and the lack of a proper enterprise CMDB. The CSD was never designed or intended for that use, and with the upcoming implementation of the CMDB, we will finally be able to transition configuration data away from the CSD to something fit-for-purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
That transition will also be a key milestone in the evolution of the CSD itself to tools that are more fit-for-purpose and specific to APM’s areas of responsibility, which is why we will be able to decommission that legacy CSD tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
In short, configuration management data will come from the CMDB (managed by Paul Lalonde) and the Service Asset and Configuration Management (SACM) team to be put in place to support it, while APM data will continue to come from the next phase (which we’re calling Bifrost) of our APM tooling journey. &#xD;
&#xD;
Obviously, it’s still vital that anyone currently consuming data or information from the CSD today have a full accounting of what they’re pulling, so that they can engage with the APM team accordingly. We don’t want anyone to be left unaware or unprepared for these transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Incidentally, I saw there was question in the EMAS chat about how to source contact data. As part of our APM tooling, we have changed from position names to position numbers, which allows us to update application  contact data with some measure of automation on a monthly basis using extracts from PeopleSoft. This provides a much higher level of reliability, since the data is coming from the authoritative source and no longer relies upon IT managers making manual updates to the corresponding records in the CSD. As a proof-of-concept, our success with this illustrates the advantages for other teams that need access to up-to-date HR data to follow in our footsteps.&#xD;

Standard personal information banks&#xD;
Personal information banks (PIBs) are descriptions of personal information under the control of a government institution that is organized and retrievable by an individual's name or by a number, symbol or other element that identifies that individual. The personal information described in a PIB has been used, is being used or is available for an administrative purpose. The PIB describes how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, retained and/or disposed of in the administration of a government institution's program or activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are three types of PIBs: central, institution-specific and standard. The following descriptions are standard PIBs. They describe information about members of the public as well as current and former federal employees contained in records created, collected and maintained by most government institutions in support of common internal services. These include personal information relating to human resources management, travel, corporate communications and other administrative services. Standard PIBs are created by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.&#xD;
&#xD;
Individuals seeking access to the institution-specific Personal Information Banks of a particular government institution should consult the institution’s Info Source chapter (https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source/list-institutions.html).&#xD;

        <documentation>ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026&#xD;
https://esdc.prv/en/news/adms-champions/2025/02/05-01.shtml&#xD;
&#xD;
The world is constantly evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities that shape the way we live and work. Whether it’s adapting to global challenges or embracing the latest technological advancements, these changes push us to think differently and act with intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Chief Data Officer at ESDC, I’ve seen first-hand how data can improve how we deliver programs and services to Canadians. Data tells a story about the people we serve and the impact of the programs and services that we deliver. By harnessing the power of data—not just as a tool, but as a foundation for smarter, more meaningful actions—we can enhance efficiency and ensure our work aligns with the needs and realities of those we serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since launching one of the first Chief Data Offices in the Government of Canada in 2016, and establishing the Chief Data Officer Branch (CDOB) in 2023, ESDC has been on a journey of growth, learning and innovation. These were not just operational changes—they also marked a culture shift. This journey marked ESDC’s commitment to treating data as shared resources that help our department solve tough problems, innovate responsibly and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;

One example of how we’ve leveraged data to improve outcomes is by linking data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. This initiative identified $192 million in unclaimed benefits for children of deceased CPP contributors or those with disabilities, demonstrating how a data-driven approach can improve effectiveness and ensure Canadians receive the benefits they’re entitled to.&#xD;
&#xD;
With that in mind, I am proud to share the ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026, CDOB’s roadmap for advancing organizational data maturity. This strategy outlines the Department’s approach to meeting the needs of the organization and the people we serve. It formalizes our commitment to treating data as a shared strategic asset that drives innovation and boosts productivity across the policy–service continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a world that is always changing, data drives our decisions and shapes understanding of the links between our policies, programs and services and the people they impact. Using data responsibly and effectively guides us through challenges and toward meaningful solutions. I am proud to be part of this journey and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.&#xD;

        <documentation>ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026&#xD;
https://esdc.prv/en/news/adms-champions/2025/02/05-01.shtml&#xD;
&#xD;
The world is constantly evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities that shape the way we live and work. Whether it’s adapting to global challenges or embracing the latest technological advancements, these changes push us to think differently and act with intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Chief Data Officer at ESDC, I’ve seen first-hand how data can improve how we deliver programs and services to Canadians. Data tells a story about the people we serve and the impact of the programs and services that we deliver. By harnessing the power of data—not just as a tool, but as a foundation for smarter, more meaningful actions—we can enhance efficiency and ensure our work aligns with the needs and realities of those we serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since launching one of the first Chief Data Offices in the Government of Canada in 2016, and establishing the Chief Data Officer Branch (CDOB) in 2023, ESDC has been on a journey of growth, learning and innovation. These were not just operational changes—they also marked a culture shift. This journey marked ESDC’s commitment to treating data as shared resources that help our department solve tough problems, innovate responsibly and ensure no one is left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
One example of how we’ve leveraged data to improve outcomes is by linking data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Canada Student Loans. This initiative identified $192 million in unclaimed benefits for children of deceased CPP contributors or those with disabilities, demonstrating how a data-driven approach can improve effectiveness and ensure Canadians receive the benefits they’re entitled to.&#xD;
&#xD;
With that in mind, I am proud to share the ESDC Data Strategy 2023-2026, CDOB’s roadmap for advancing organizational data maturity. This strategy outlines the Department’s approach to meeting the needs of the organization and the people we serve. It formalizes our commitment to treating data as a shared strategic asset that drives innovation and boosts productivity across the policy–service continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a world that is always changing, data drives our decisions and shapes understanding of the links between our policies, programs and services and the people they impact. Using data responsibly and effectively guides us through challenges and toward meaningful solutions. I am proud to be part of this journey and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.&#xD;

Office of the Prime Minister&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Colleagues:&#xD;
Last month, Canadians elected a new Government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone. As members of the 30th Ministry, we must fulfill this mandate with purpose and force. We must meet a series of unprecedented challenges with both a disciplined focus on core priorities and new approaches to governing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Context: A Generational Challenge&#xD;
Canada faces a series of crises. In a more dangerous and divided world, geopolitical risks are rising, threatening our sovereignty. The global trading system – which has helped power Canada’s prosperity for decades – is undergoing the biggest transformation since the fall of the Berlin Wall. At home, our longstanding weak productivity is straining government finances, making life less affordable for Canadian families, and threatening to undermine the sustainability of vital social programs on which Canadians rely.&#xD;
&#xD;
The new federal Government has an immense responsibility to address these challenges head on with focus, determination, and fundamentally different approaches to governing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must redefine Canada’s international, commercial, and security relationships. In the process, we need to develop a defence industrial policy that secures Canada, fulfills our responsibilities to our allies, and helps build our economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada must build an enormous amount of new infrastructure at speeds not seen in generations. This includes the infrastructure to diversify our trading relationships; to become an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energies; to restore affordability to housing; and to secure our borders and our communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The combination of the scale of this infrastructure build and the transformative nature of artificial intelligence (AI) will create opportunities for millions of Canadians to find new rewarding careers – provided they have timely access to the education and training they need to develop the necessary skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
Government itself must become much more productive by deploying AI at scale, by focusing on results over spending, and by using scarce tax dollars to catalyse multiples of private investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our Priorities&#xD;
We will focus on seven priorities:&#xD;
&#xD;
Establishing a new economic and security relationship with the United States and strengthening our collaboration with reliable trading partners and allies around the world.&#xD;
Building one Canadian economy by removing barriers to interprovincial trade and identifying and expediting nation-building projects that will connect and transform our country.&#xD;
Bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them to get ahead.&#xD;
Making housing more affordable by unleashing the power of public-private cooperation, catalysing a modern housing industry, and creating new careers in the skilled trades.&#xD;
Protecting Canadian sovereignty and keeping Canadians safe by strengthening the Canadian Armed Forces, securing our borders, and reinforcing law enforcement.&#xD;
Attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.&#xD;
Spending less on government operations so that Canadians can invest more in the people and businesses that will build the strongest economy in the G7.&#xD;
Working Together&#xD;
We must deliver for Canadians as a team committed to real Cabinet government. The attainment of these objectives will require collaboration and coordination within Cabinet. I expect each Cabinet committee, led by their Chair, to drive and monitor our progress, with oversight from the Priorities, Planning and Strategy Committee, and direction from the full Cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
While fulfilling your core responsibilities as a member of the Ministry, you should identify how specifically you can contribute to these missions. You will be expected and empowered to lead, and to bring new ideas, clear focus, and decisive action to your work. Over the coming weeks, I will look to each of you to identify the key goals and measures of success on which to evaluate the results you will achieve for Canadians as a member of the Ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
We will work together with Parliamentarians and the public service. We will work in true partnership with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples. And we will bring together labour, business, and civil society to build a Canada worthy of our children and grandchildren.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addressing the tasks before us, we must remain true to Canadian values. Canada is a dynamic country that celebrates our diversity, cares for the most vulnerable among us, and strives for a better future for all. The new federal Government will continue the vital work of advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples. We will fight climate change. We will uphold the rule of law, protect our democratic institutions, and reinforce the unity of our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s challenges are not small, but we can more than meet them with vigour and a constructive approach. That is how Canadians have built the best country in the world. That is how we will build it to be even better.&#xD;
&#xD;
In partnership,&#xD;

Speech from the Throne to open the first session of the 45th Parliament of Canada&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
It is with a sense of deep pride and pleasure that my wife and I join you here today, as we witness Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride, unity, and hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people. This land acknowledgement is a recognition of shared history as a nation. While continuing to deepen my own understanding, it is my great hope that in each of your communities, and collectively as a country, a path is found toward truth and reconciliation, in both word and deed.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is my 20th visit to Canada, spread over the course of more than half a century, and my first as Sovereign. As I have said before, “Every time I come to Canada… a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart.” I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada’s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values, and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
To the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples – you have welcomed my family and myself to your traditional lands with great warmth and hospitality, for which I am humbly grateful.&#xD;
&#xD;
This year, we mark the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and V-J Day. On Juno Beach, at Dieppe, on the Somme, at Beaumont-Hamel, at Ypres, and on Vimy Ridge… At those places, and many others, forever etched into our memories, Canadians fought and died alongside our closest allies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Today, I see representatives from every part of Canada – from St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to Victoria, British Columbia, and Arviat, Nunavut. I see the guardians of the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Canadian Charter and, as King, I thank you for your service to your fellow Canadians, across the length and breadth of this vast and great nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
You speak for your communities, representing an incredible richness of cultures, languages, and perspectives. We owe it to this generation, and those who succeed us, to think and act for the greater good of all. While the world faces unprecedented challenges, generating uncertainties across the continents with regards to peace and stability, economics, and climate change, your communities have the skills and determination to bring a wealth of solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
By fostering collaboration and engaging in respectful, constructive debates, you will ensure this Government is capable of bold and fair action to support Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
It has been nearly 70 years since the Sovereign first opened Parliament. In the time since, Canada has dramatically changed: repatriating its Constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth. Canada has embraced its British, French, and Indigenous roots, and become a bold, ambitious, innovative country that is bilingual, truly multicultural, and committed to reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present. As it should, it stands proudly as a symbol of Canada today, in all her richness and dynamism.&#xD;
&#xD;
Opening&#xD;
When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory. The Cold War was intensifying. Freedom and democracy were under threat. Canada was emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world. In the decades since, history has been punctuated by epoch-making events: the Vietnam War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the start of the War on Terror. Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect.&#xD;
&#xD;
The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada’s relationships with partners are also changing.&#xD;
&#xD;
We must be clear-eyed: the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War. Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling. Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity. An opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War. A confident Canada, which has welcomed new Canadians, including from some of the most tragic global conflict zones, can seize this opportunity by recognising that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away. And that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.   &#xD;
&#xD;
Building new relationships with the United States and the world&#xD;
The Prime Minister and the President of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S., rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government is working to strengthen its relationships with reliable trading partners and allies around the world, recognizing that Canada has what the world needs and the values the world respects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada is ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries that share its values, that believe in international co-operation and the free and open exchange of goods, services, and ideas. In this new, fast-evolving world, Canada is ready to lead. This will be demonstrated in June, when Canada convenes the G7 Summit.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a more affordable Canada&#xD;
The Government is guided by its conviction that the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone. Many Canadians are struggling to get ahead. The Government is responding, reducing middle-class taxes and saving two-income families up to $840 a year. It will cut the GST on homes at or under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, delivering savings of up to $50,000. And it will lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect the programs that are already saving families thousands of dollars every year. These include child care and pharmacare. In addition to these, the Government has recently expanded the Canadian Dental Care Plan to cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a stronger Canada&#xD;
The Government’s overarching goal – its core mission – is to build the strongest economy in the G7. That starts with creating one Canadian economy out of thirteen. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year. The Government will introduce legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility by Canada Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Numerous premiers have already taken vital steps to break down provincial and territorial barriers to trade. Together, we will build on that progress to deliver free trade across the nation by Canada Day. This is critical to unlocking Canada’s full economic potential, but it’s not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
To build Canada strong, the Government is working closely with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples to identify and catalyse projects of national significance. Projects that will connect Canada, that will deepen Canada’s ties with the world, and that will create high-paying jobs for generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Given the pace of change and the scale of opportunities, speed is of the essence. Through the creation of a new Major Federal Project Office, the time needed to approve a project will be reduced from five years to two; all while upholding Canada’s world-leading environmental standards and its constitutional obligations to Indigenous Peoples.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will also strike co-operation agreements with every interested province and territory within six months to realize its goal of “one project, one review.”&#xD;
&#xD;
When Canadians come together, Canada builds things that last.&#xD;
&#xD;
By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don’t just survive ongoing trade wars, but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world’s leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change. To build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the skilled trades. And to build Canada into the world’s leading hub for science and innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Critically, the Government will undertake a series of measures to help double the rate of home building while creating an entirely new housing industry – using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, and Canadian lumber. The Government will introduce measures to deliver affordable homes by creating Build Canada Homes. This mission-driven organization will act to accelerate the development of new affordable housing. It will invest in the growth of the prefabricated and modular housing industry. And it will provide significant financing to affordable home builders. The Government will make the housing market work better, including by cutting municipal development charges in half for all multi-unit housing. The Government will drive supply up to bring housing costs down.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a safer and more secure Canada &#xD;
To be truly strong, Canada must be secure. To that end, the Government will introduce legislation to enhance security at Canada’s borders. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will have new tools to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors. The Canada Border Services Agency will be given new powers to examine goods destined for export, to prevent the transport of illegal and stolen products, including cars.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will protect Canada’s sovereignty by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will boost Canada’s defence industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada’s European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad. To keep communities safe, the Government will hire 1,000 more RCMP personnel. It will change firearms licensing and strengthen enforcement of yellow and red flag laws. Weapons licences for those convicted of intimate partner violence and those subject to protection orders will be revoked. Through the deployment of scanners, drones and helicopters, additional personnel, and K-9 teams, the Government will stem the tide of illegal guns and drugs across the border.&#xD;
&#xD;
It will take these steps while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners and Indigenous Peoples’ longstanding hunting traditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will bring a renewed focus on car theft and home invasions by toughening the Criminal Code to make bail harder to get for repeat offenders charged with committing these crimes, along with human trafficking and drug smuggling.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building a united Canada&#xD;
During this time of great change, Canadians are uniting behind what makes Canada unique.&#xD;
&#xD;
The French language and the Quebec culture are at the heart of the Canadian identity. They define the country that Canadians and I love so much. Canada is a country that respects and celebrates its official languages and Indigenous languages. The Government is determined to protect the institutions that bring these cultures and this identity to the world, like CBC/Radio-Canada. It will protect the people who give us access to fresh, healthy, and quality food: agricultural producers. And it will protect supply management.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nature is core to Canada’s identity. In 2022, Canada convened COP15 in Montréal, which concluded with 196 countries striking a historic agreement to protect 30 percent of their lands and 30 percent of waters by 2030. To this end, the Government will protect more of Canada’s nature than ever before through the creation of new national parks, national urban parks, marine protected areas, and other conservation initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will always protect the rights and freedoms that the Charter guarantees for every Canadian.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will be a reliable partner to Indigenous Peoples, upholding its fundamental commitment to advancing reconciliation. Central to this commitment is the creation of long-term wealth and prosperity with Indigenous Peoples. For that reason, the Government will double the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program from $5 billion to $10 billion – enabling more Indigenous communities to become owners of major projects. As Canada moves forward with nation-building projects, the Government will always be firmly guided by the principle of free, prior, and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada’s immigration system has long been a source of pride for Canadians and of dynamism for the economy. The Government is dedicated to rebuilding the trust of Canadians in immigration by restoring balance to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Government will cap the total number of temporary foreign workers and international students to less than five percent of Canada’s population by 2027. By doing this, the Government will attract the best talent in the world to build our economy, while sending a clear message to Canadians working abroad that there is no better time to come home.&#xD;
&#xD;
Building Canada Strong by spending less and investing more&#xD;
In all of its actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can invest more.&#xD;
&#xD;
Day-to-day government spending – the government’s operating budget – has been growing by nine percent every year. The Government will introduce measures to bring it below two percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Transfers to provinces, territories, or individuals will be maintained. The Government will balance its operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication, and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In parallel, the Government will take a series of measures to catalyse new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. The scale of the Government’s initiative will match the challenges of our times and the ambitions of Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
Honourable Senators,&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons,&#xD;
&#xD;
When my dear late mother addressed your predecessors seven decades ago, she said that in that age, and against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself. It is a source of great pride that, in the following decades, Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.&#xD;
&#xD;
I wish to express to you and to the people of Canada my heartfelt gratitude, and that of my wife, for the warmth of the welcome which we have received.&#xD;
&#xD;
As the anthem reminds us: The True North is indeed strong and free!&#xD;
&#xD;
Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.&#xD;
&#xD;
May you honour the profound trust bestowed upon you by Canadians, and may God bless and guide you in all your duties.&#xD;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xD;
This business case demonstrates the value of a new Data Collection System (DCS) for the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy (YESS). The YESS was modernized in 2019 to adapt to emerging labour market conditions and improve outcomes for youth facing barriers to employment. To support modernization, a new Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) has been implemented. In order to support this, the Department requires the new DCS to continue the collection, storage and analysis of program data for the YESS from its twelve horizontal delivery partners. There was a previous DCS, however it was decommissioned due to system security issues, lack of ability to make meaningful performance measurement updates, and severe technical debt. The YESS-DCS is necessary to support core program functions such as meeting reporting and evaluation requirements. It will also help grow the program's impact for Canadian youth by allowing for easier, timelier access to better data about program outcomes and allowing for adaptive policy/program responses.</documentation>

Légende : Message de la ministre – Un message pour les employés d’EDSC&#xD;
Chers collègues,&#xD;
Il y a 20 ans cette semaine, le gouvernement fédéral a pris une grande décision : créer Service Canada, en tant que point d’accès unique où les Canadiens pourraient recevoir un vaste éventail de prestations et de services gouvernementaux conçus pour les aider à traverser toutes les étapes de la vie.&#xD;
Depuis 20 ans, Service Canada remplit cette mission, et en a fait bien plus encore. Par téléphone, en personne dans les Centres Service Canada, aux sites de services mobiles dans les communautés, et dans les coulisses de nos centres de traitement, Service Canada a été une présence fiable dans tout le pays, jour après jour, même dans les circonstances les plus difficiles. Les exemples suivants ne sont que quelques-unes des façons dont Service Canada change la donne :&#xD;
Renforcer le filet de sécurité sociale du Canada&#xD;
Personne ne devrait être laissé pour compte dans notre pays. Service Canada joue un rôle essentiel pour éliminer les obstacles et créer des possibilités économiques pour tous. C’est pourquoi, à un moment où faisons face aux graves conséquences de la guerre commerciale avec l’un de nos plus importants partenaires commerciaux, l’assurance-emploi demeure la pierre angulaire du filet de sécurité sociale du Canada en soutenant les travailleurs lorsque survient une perte d’emploi, un congé parental ou une maladie ou lorsqu’ils doivent assumer des responsabilités d’aidant naturel.&#xD;
Élargir l’accès aux programmes essentiels&#xD;
Service Canada continue d’élargir l’accès à des programmes essentiels qui favorisent la santé et le bien-être financier des Canadiens. Le lancement du Régime canadien de soins dentaires a ouvert la voie à des soins dentaires abordables aux personnes admissibles à travers le pays. Plus récemment, Service Canada a amorcé le traitement des demandes pour la Prestation canadienne pour les personnes handicapées, qui offre du soutien financier direct aux personnes en situation de handicap. &#xD;
Ce travail va au-delà de l’équité, il s’agit de créer un véritable changement, de favoriser l’autonomie des individus et d’aider les Canadiens à bâtir un avenir plus solide en leur permettant de s’épanouir pleinement.&#xD;
Moderniser et améliorer la prestation des services&#xD;
À mesure que les besoins des Canadiens évoluent, Service Canada a élargi son offre afin de fournir du soutien plus accessible et plus réactif. L’une des principales avancées a été l’amélioration des outils libre-service pour les clients de la Sécurité de la vieillesse (SV). Aujourd’hui, plus de 7,4 millions de Canadiens peuvent demander des prestations de la SV en ligne, mettre à jour leurs renseignements personnels, télécharger des documents et accéder à leurs relevés fiscaux ou les télécharger, le tout grâce à un service numérique simplifié. &#xD;
Notre force, ce sont nos employés&#xD;
Que ce soit en offrant du soutien à des millions de Canadiens, en assurant l’accès à des prestations et services ou en retroussant nos manches en situation de crise nationale comme la pandémie de COVID 19, les employés de Service Canada sont toujours à la hauteur de la tâche par leur dévouement, leur compassion et leur professionnalisme.&#xD;
Ce 20e anniversaire, c’est davantage qu’un chiffre. C’est l’occasion de rendre hommage aux personnes qui œuvrent dans l’ombre du nom de Service Canada, aux personnes qui travaillent, jour après jour, pour offrir aux Canadiens le soutien dont ils ont besoin. L’engagement à servir le public n’est pas toujours facile à respecter, mais d’avoir la confiance des Canadiens au quotidien est une récompense plus que suffisante.&#xD;
Notre objectif pour l’avenir : renforcer la promesse faite par le gouvernement aux Canadiens et rendre les services gouvernementaux plus inclusifs, accessibles et axés sur le public.&#xD;
La contribution que vous apportez est inestimable et instrumentale au succès du Canada, génération après génération.&#xD;
Merci pour tout votre travail et bravo pour ces 20 années au service de notre pays et de nos collectivités.&#xD;

Caption: Minister’s Message – A message for ESDC employees&#xD;
Dear colleagues,&#xD;
Two decades ago, the federal government took an important step to establish Service Canada as a single point of access where Canadians could receive a wide range of government benefits and services designed to support them through life’s many transitions.&#xD;
For 20 years, Service Canada has fulfilled that mission—and done so much more. By phone, in-person at Service Canada Centres, at community outreach sites, and behind the scenes in our processing centres, Service Canada has been a reliable presence across the country—day in and day out—even in the most challenging circumstances. The following examples highlight just some of the ways Service Canada is making a difference:&#xD;
Strengthening Canada’s social safety net&#xD;
Nobody should be left behind in this country. Service Canada’s role is critical in breaking down barriers and building economic opportunity for all. That is why, as we’re navigating the serious consequences of the trade war with one of our most important trade partners, Employment Insurance (EI) remains a cornerstone of Canada’s social safety net, supporting workers through job loss, parental leave, illness and caregiving responsibilities. &#xD;
Expanding access to essential programs&#xD;
Service Canada continues to broaden access to vital programs that support Canadians’ health and financial well-being. The launch of the Canadian Dental Care Plan has opened the door to affordable dental care for eligible individuals across the country. More recently, Service Canada began processing applications for the Canada Disability Benefit, delivering direct financial support to persons with disabilities.&#xD;
This work goes beyond fairness—it’s about creating meaningful change, empowering individuals, and helping Canadians build a stronger future by unlocking their full potential.&#xD;
Modernizing and improving service delivery&#xD;
As Canadians’ needs continue to evolve, Service Canada has expanded its offerings to provide more accessible and responsive support. One key advancement has been the enhancement of self-serve tools for Old Age Security (OAS) clients. Today, more than 7.4 million Canadians can apply for OAS benefits online, update personal information, upload documents and access or download their tax slips—all through a streamlined digital service. &#xD;
Our strength is our people&#xD;
Whether it’s providing support to millions of Canadians to ensuring access to benefits and services or stepping up during times of national crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, Service Canada employees have consistently shown that they are up to the task through their dedication, compassion and professionalism.&#xD;
This 20-year anniversary goes far beyond a number, it's a celebration of the people behind the name, those who work to make sure Canadians have the support they need. Commitment to public service isn’t always easy, but earning the trust of Canadians every day makes it all worth it. &#xD;
As we move forward, let’s build on the Government’s commitment to Canadians: to make government services more inclusive, accessible and focused on people. &#xD;
Your contributions are highly valued and instrumental to Canada’s success, across generations.&#xD;
Thank you for your work, and congratulations on 20 years of service to our country and communities. &#xD;
&#xD;
