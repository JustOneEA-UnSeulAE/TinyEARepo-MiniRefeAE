        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Interoperable Digital Public Services Implementation Orientation ABB is a Business Object setting decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events &#xD;
&#xD;
The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); &#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  &#xD;
&#xD;
•	The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:&#xD;
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);&#xD;
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an&#xD;
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).&#xD;

        <documentation>Digital Encoding of Characters. To be of any use in computers, in computer communications and in particular on the World Wide Web, characters must be encoded. In fact, much of the information processed by computers over the last few decades has been encoded text, exceptions being images, audio, video and numeric data. To achieve text encoding, a large variety of character encodings have been devised. Character encodings can loosely be explained as mappings between the character sequences that users manipulate and the sequences of bits that computers manipulate.&#xD;

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8.&#xD;
UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.&#xD;
UTF-8 has a one-octet encoding unit.  It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.&#xD;
UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number, a.k.a. code position, code point or Unicode scalar value).&#xD;

UUID&#xD;
A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. Since a UUID is a fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to rollover.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot; are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.&#xD;

Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles : date and language&#xD;
date: Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date, we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date. This property can take a string value. We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF.&#xD;
language: The language needs to be selected from a controlled list. We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 for the representation of names of languages (such as &quot;&quot;eng&quot;&quot; for &quot;&quot;English&quot;&quot;) together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype. For this, we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language, which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string.&#xD;

This guide details an example of using the OCDS 1.1 Field Level Mapping Template to map the fields from a single table in a fictional e-GP system to OCDS. &#xD;
&#xD;
Step 1: Source System Details&#xD;
OCDS data may originate in multiple source systems, therefore it is important to record the details of the source system we are mapping from. &#xD;
Step 2: Source Field Details&#xD;
Using the (Source) Fields sheet, populate the following information for each field in the source table: the system the field is from (as recorded in step 1); the table in which the field is located; the field title.&#xD;
Where additional context is required you may also record a narrative description of the source field in the description field and it might also be useful to add an example of the value that the field takes alongside further technical information on the type and multiplicity of the field.&#xD;
Step 3: Mapping&#xD;
The mapping template has a sheet for each stage of the contracting process, from (OCDS) 2. Planning through to (OCDS) 6. Implementation, with details of the relevant fields from the OCDS schema, in addition to the (OCDS) 1. General (all stages) sheet which contains fields relevant to all stages of the contracting process. Review each of the (OCDS) sheets in the mapping template to identify fields in the OCDS schema to which a field in the source system can be mapped. &#xD;
Step 4: Review&#xD;
Repeat steps 1-3 for all tables and all source systems to complete the mapping.&#xD;
Gaps in currently held data: if you identify data OCDS requests, but that you do not hold, engage with data users to consider whether this additional data could and should be provided.&#xD;
Gaps in OCDS: you might have data which is not covered by OCDS. In these cases, talk with the OCDS helpdesk to see whether this should be included in an extension to the standard. Additional fields can be documented at the bottom of each mapping sheet in the template.&#xD;

AS4 Profile specification&#xD;
The eDelivery AS4 Profile is a modular profile of the ebMS3 and AS4 OASIS specifications. Its core is a mandatory Common Profile that selects, extends and profiles the AS4 ebHandler Conformance Profile and AS4 Additional Features and provides a common Usage Profile. This Common Profile can be implemented using open source or closed source AS4 software implementations. It is aligned with, and corresponds to a subset of, the AS4 profile for TSOs (Transmission System Operators) developed by ENTSOG (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas).&#xD;
In addition to the Common Profile, this specification provides a number of optional Profile Enhancement modules that specify functionality enhancements covering AS4 message exchange in four corner topologies, the use of AS4 in conjunction with the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) specification, and Dynamic Receiver and Dynamic Sender behavior.&#xD;

Reference Data Policy ABB is a Business Object being applied to data used to organise or categorise other data, or for relating data to information both within and beyond the boundaries of the enterprise. Usually it mandates the use of codes and descriptions, or definitions.

Source: DAMA DM_BOK
(http://www.dama.org)

Reference data consists typically of a small, discrete set of values that are not updated as part of business transactions but are usually used to impose consistent classiﬁcation. Reference data normally has a low update frequency. Reference data is relevant across more than one business systems belonging to different organisations and sectors 
[Source: J. Jordan &amp; C. Ellen (2009). Business need, data and business intelligence].

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
IoP Dimension: Governance IoP 
The Reference Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because Reference Data can be shared and reused (e.g. in the form of taxonomies or controlled vocabularies) between organisation to agree on some  basic information. Management of reference data is a priority as suggested by EIF's recommendation 31: &quot;Put in place an information management strategy at the highest possible level to avoid fragmentation and duplication. Management of metadata, master data and reference data should be prioritised.&quot;

Documents are stored in different formats: pdf format (if available in paper form only and subsequently digitised) or word, excel, tif, rtf, html, txt version (if received as such or produced by DG Competition). CMAfx contains also procedural steps and case information, such as the composition of the case team, relevant legal basis, type of case, priority, name of undertaking concerned etc. Access to CMAfx is restricted to DG Competition personnel and national experts on secondment using DG Competition IT infrastructure. The undertakings answering the queries are obliged to indicate the confidentiality status of their responses, i.e., whether their answer must be treated as confidential, and in that case the system does not allow submission of their responses until a non-confidential answer has been provided for each confidential one. The non-confidential versions of the Commission's decisions adopted pursuant to articles 7-10, 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003 are published on DG Competition website, after the confidentiality claims (with regard to business secrets and other confidential information) were cleared with the respective parties. &#xD;

DIRECTIVE 2014/24/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (Text with EEA relevance). The directive sets out rules on the use of public contracts for the provision of works, supplies or services by companies or individuals and the exemptions which can be applied. The legislation specifies that when national authorities use public procurement to invite tenders to provide works, supplies or services, they must treat all applicants equally and not discriminate between them. They must also be transparent in their dealings. This Directive is considered as a Legal Interoperability Specification, as it shall be transposed in a National or Regional Binding Instrument when designing the solution using the e-procurement Solution Architecture Template.&#xD;

1.	A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The Union shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.&#xD;
2.	The Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas referred to in this Article and, if necessary, lend support to their action. It shall in particular encourage cooperation between the Member States to improve the complementarity of their health services in cross-border areas. Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes in the areas referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.&#xD;
3.	The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.&#xD;
4.	By way of derogation from Article 2(5) and Article 6(a) and in accordance with Article 4(2)(k) the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article through adopting in order to meet common safety concerns: (a) measures setting high standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives; these measures shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures; (b) measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective the protection of public health; (c) measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use.&#xD;
5.	The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health and in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco and the abuse of alcohol, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.&#xD;
6.	The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in this Article.&#xD;
7.	Union action shall respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of the Member States shall include the management of health services and medical care and the allocation of the resources assigned to them. The measures referred to in paragraph 4(a) shall not affect national provisions on the donation or medical use of organs and blood.&#xD;

EURES - Job vacancy&#xD;
Most of the jobs on the EURES Job Mobility Portal come from the job vacancies databases managed by the Public Employment Services of the countries participating in EURES. Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:&#xD;
“EURES jobs&quot;, displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.&#xD;
There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as &quot;EURES jobs&quot;. This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.&#xD;

EUCARIS - registry network&#xD;
EUCARIS is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the data-exchange regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, and the accompanying personal data. For this exchange, a system is used which was especially developed for this purpose: EUCARIS II. It is essential to note that EUCARIS makes no use of a central European database. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The national registration authority becomes a central hub in EUCARIS.&#xD;

The Descriptive Metadata Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because metadata facilitates opening and sharing data by providing the appropriate format, description of the content, high level of quality in order to achieve interoperability as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 42: &quot;[..] Ensure that open data is accompanied by high quality, machine-readable metadata in non-proprietary formats, including a description of their content, the way data is collected and its level of quality and the licence terms under which it is made available. The use of common vocabularies for expressing metadata is recommended.&quot;

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description&#xD;
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description. The name &quot;Dublin&quot; is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; &quot;core&quot; because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a wide range of resources.&#xD;
The fifteen element &quot;Dublin Core&quot; described in this standard is part of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical specifications maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). The full set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCMI-TERMS], also includes sets of resource classes (including the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE]), vocabulary encoding schemes, and syntax encoding schemes. The terms in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination with terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles and on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM].&#xD;

e-Justice Portal - Commission's approach on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission
Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46 of 10 January 2017 on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission. The Commission's approach should take into account EU policy initiatives and legislation on network and information security, industry standards and good practices, to comply with all relevant legislation and to allow interoperability and compatibility.  This decision applies to all communication and information systems (CISs) which are owned, procured, managed or operated by or on behalf of the Commission and all usage of those CISs by the Commission.
This decision sets out the basic principles, objectives, organisation and responsibilities regarding the security of those CISs, and in particular for Commission departments owning, procuring, managing or operating CISs and including CISs provided by an internal IT service provider.

Data Policy ABB is a Business Object being applied to a trusted authentic source of information under the control of an appointed public administration or organisation appointed by government.

According to the European Interoperability Framework, base registries are: “reliable sources of basic information on items such as persons, companies, vehicles, licenses, buildings, locations and roads” and “are authentic and authoritative and form, separately or in combination, the cornerstone of public services”.

The Base Registry Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because base registries include &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be properly governed and made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;. EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).

GOOD PRACTICES ON BUILDING SUCESSFUL INTERCONNECTIONS OF BASE REGISTRIES&#xD;
In order to provide quick and user-friendly public services to citizens and businesses, public administrations are trying to adopt customer-centric approaches and readjust their ways of working.&#xD;
One way to achieve efficiency and increase user-friendliness is through the ‘once-only principle’. Instead of asking the citizen for information that they have already provided, public administrations will reuse the information they already have. Much of this information is stored in authoritative databases called base registries. As the authentic sources of data for public administrations, base registries are one of the basic building blocks of public services and are the key to making the once-only principle a reality.&#xD;
The document contains some good practices to foster access to the data contained in these base registries.&#xD;
The good practices presented, are grouped according to the layered interoperability model proposed by the European Interoperability&#xD;
Framework (EIF).&#xD;

The Competent Body is the independent organisation responsible for assessing, awarding, and managing EU Ecolabel applications and licences on the national level. The Competent Body provides guidance on the documents needed for the dossier, such as declarations, data sheets, and test results. Recommendations on product testing laboratories that are ISO 17025 accredited or equivalent are shared, along with any relevant technical expertise needed to complete the application.&#xD;
Upon application approval, the Competent Body issues the contract and licence upon approving the application. This contract sets out the services or range of products covered within the licence, including any trade names or manufacturer’s internal reference numbers. It will also lay out the terms of use of the EU Ecolabel, following the standard contract in Annex IV of the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of 25 November 2009. Once the contract has been signed, a certificate can be asked for/will be sent, depending on the Competent Body. This certificate will detail: the licence number that can be used with the EU Ecolabel logo; the legal name of the applicant; the services or range of products awarded the EU Ecolabel; all relevant trade names under which the product is sold or the service is marketed. The Competent Body will give the final validation on when the EU Ecolabel logo and the licence number can be used on the EU Ecolabel services and products that have met the criteria.&#xD;

It is a legal resource on governance rules enabling collaboration between digital public services cross legal jurisdictions.  Generally speaking it is of a generic not binding nature like the declarations  of Tallinn and Berlin (typically involving many legal jurisdictions). Legal agreements of binding nature typically take the form of binding legal acts like the reference list of offences punishable in the European arrest warrant (2002/584/JHA: Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002).  &#xD;

An example of a treaty that does have provisions for further binding agreements is the UN Charter. By signing and ratifying the Charter, countries agreed to be legally bound by resolutions passed by UN bodies such as the General Assembly and the Security Council. Thus, UN resolutions are legally binding on UN Member States, and no signature or ratification is necessary.</documentation>

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) - The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. The new EIF is undertaken in the context of the Commission priority to create a Digital Single Market in Europe. The public sector, which accounts for over a quarter of total employment and represents approximately a fifth of the EU’s GDP through public procurement, plays a key role in the Digital Single Market as a regulator, services provider and employer. The successful implementation of the EIF will improve the quality of European public services and will create an environment where public administrations can collaborate digitally. (https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en)

Interoperability Saliency: The Interoperability Framework ABB is salient for organizational interoperability because it determines a set of rules, practices and a commonly agreed approach to the delivery of European public services.

Interoperability Saliency: The Open Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because Open Data is a part of the basic components of the EIF's conceptual model for integrated public services. Opening of public sector datasets for sharing and reuse is encouraged by the Directive on the reuse of public sector information, which provides a common legal framework for reuse of public sector data as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 2: &quot;Publish the data you own as open data unless certain restrictions apply.&quot;

Additional information: Open Data Policyspecifically refers to publish (raw) data in a way that is accessible, reusable, findable, machine readable and licensed permissively. It can be generated by a wide range of parties, including public authorities, the semi-public sector, businesses and the public. In the case of public authorities, such as European Union organisations, making their data available for public reuse supports economic development, openness and transparency.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The EU cybersecurity certification framework - The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation. - On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act''). Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;

Interoperability Saliency: The Security Framework ABB is salient for legal and organizational interoperability due to it permits the establishment of security and privacy procedures and rules to determine the provision of public services. This framework will provide secure and trustworthy data exchange between public administrations and in interactions with citizens and businesses.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): EU SCIENCE HUB - The European Commission's science and knowledge service - JRC's Data policy: The JRC's data policy is driven by transparency with the aim of contributing to innovation. It is a pillar of the development and implementation of scientific knowledge management at the JRC. It follows the commitments and regulatory basis of the Commission Decision on the reuse of Commission documents (2011/833/EU). The objectives for adopting and implementing the JRC data policy include: • Share and use data on the basis of the JRC Open Data principles: fully, freely, openly and timely; • To be transparent on the reasons for restricted access to certain data; • Provide a coordinated approach to the acquisition of data by the JRC; • Facilitate management, broaden access and use of JRC data; • Reinforce goals of Horizon 2020; • Support EU implementation of the G8 Open Data Charter; • Continuously support evidence-based decision making and research; • Ensure that JRC data is made available through the EU Open Data Portal. For a successful implementation process, the JRC's data policy lays down implementation principles with respect to responsible entities, overall implementation guidelines, and their individual elements like data management plans, as well as the monitoring of its implementation. https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/about/jrc-in-brief/data-policy

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC of 14 March 2007, Article 18. Member States shall ensure that appropriate structures and mechanisms are designated for coordinating, across the different levels of government, the contributions of all those with an interest in their infrastructures for spatial information. These structures shall coordinate the contributions of, inter alia, users, producers, added-value service providers and coordinating bodies, concerning the identification of relevant data sets, user needs, the provision of information on existing practices and the provision of feedback on the implementation of this Directive. (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002&amp;from=EN)

Interoperability Saliency: The Digital Governance Plan ABB is salient for governance and organizational interoperability because it helps to (i) establish and holistic approach to data exchange and management, and (ii) determine the common instruments to achieve interoperability across administrative levels and sectors.

Additional information: Plans are in principle narrower and more detailed than Digital Agendas, and as a matter of fact they are intended to drill down and realise a global agenda. For an additional example of plan focused on interoperability, see the Governance Plan defined in the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) - § 3.1 of the new EIF Annex II: Interoperability governance refers to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels. The European interoperability framework, the Interoperability Action Plan (Annex 1 to the Communication) and the European interoperability architecture (EIRA) are important parts of interoperability governance at the EU level.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Performance-based Full Policy Cycle for the Digital Single Market (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/507457/IPOL-IMCO_ET(2013)507457_EN.pdf). The key features of a performance-based full policy cycle are a clear articulation of policy objectives, the identification and use of quantitative indicators of expected short-term and longer-term policy impacts, the identification of synergies between policies, a much greater use of quantitative data in ex-ante impact assessments, the implementation of robust, data-based, independent ex post assessments of the performance of policies relative to their expected impacts and a wide dissemination of lessons learned in such ex-post performance assessments

Interoperability Saliency: The Public Policy Cycle ABB is salient for the governance  interoperability because it impacts on the design and formulation of public policies, which are implemented through legal acts. Also, the ABB also is salient for the legal interoperability due to it establis the legal actions and directives for public administration services as the case of interoperability principles need to be taken into account during the whole public policy cycle.

Additional information: Policies (and legislative acts) are digital-ready if they enable smooth and digital by default policy implementation and foster digital transformation through best use of digital technologies and data. This implies that policymakers work in a multidisciplinary team and consider the following digital-ready components: 1. user-centric processes ready for automation, 2. alignment with digital policies (for example on accessibility, eID...), 3. the once-only principle and the reuse of data, 4. the evolving ICT landscape, 5. innovation and digital technologies, and 6. digital-ready drafting.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): In the GDPR, &quot;controller&quot;, or &quot;processor&quot; on behalf of the &quot;controller&quot; are examples of the data owner role defined for this ABB. See GDPR https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN , Article 4, Definitions.

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Holder ABB is salient for organizational interoperability because it plays a pivotal role in facilitating data access and sharing within the framework of the Data Governance Act. This designation applies to both legal entities, such as public sector bodies and international organizations, and individuals authorized by applicable Union or national law to grant access to specific personal or non-personal data. By delineating responsibilities and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, the identification of Data Holders fosters transparency, accountability, and alignment with data governance policies, ultimately promoting seamless data interoperability within organizational contexts

Additional information: Data owners may not work with their data every day, but are responsible for overseeing and protecting a data domain. In the context of the GDPR, data owners are accountable for the quality, integrity, and protection of their data space. In SiMPL (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/simpl-cloud-edge-federations-and-data-spaces-made-simple), the data owner is the legal entity that has sovereignty over the data, usually the creator of the data or the one who executes control over the data. See SiMPL requirements and architecture vision document. The Data Governance Act does not define the concept Data Owner, but intrinsically this role can be assigned also to the Data Holder, since &quot;holding&quot; usually entails &quot;controlling&quot;.

Example: An example of a treaty that does have provisions for further binding agreements is the UN Charter. By signing and ratifying the Charter, countries agreed to be legally bound by resolutions passed by UN bodies such as the General Assembly and the Security Council. Thus, UN resolutions are legally binding on UN Member States, and no signature or ratification is necessary. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA3djvvbT2AhX1SPEDHdmuCqMQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phe.gov%2Fs3%2Flaw%2FPages%2FInternational.aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw23fJMEr0G7JOPyleNl2lrd

Interoperability Saliency: The Legal Agreement ABB is salient for the governance interoperability because it sets the foundations for the coordination or harmonization between different legislations. Also this ABB is salient for the legal governance in the way of establishing the required business rules facilitate data exchange between public services at lower level.

Additional information: Generally speaking a Legal Agreement Contract t is of a generic not binding nature like the declarations of Tallinn and Berlin (typically involving many legal jurisdictions). Legal agreements of binding nature typically take the form of binding legal acts like the reference list of offences punishable in the European arrest warrant (2002/584/JHA: Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002).

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI), a technical and operational standard which must be met by each subsystem or part of subsystem in order to meet the essential requirements and ensure the interoperability of the railway system of the European Union. Directive (EU) 2016/797 defines the subsystems, either structural or functional, forming part of the railway system of the European Union. For each of those subsystems, the essential requirements need to be specified and the technical specifications determined, particularly in respect of constituents and interfaces, in order to meet those essential requirements. The essential requirements can be summarised as safety, reliability and availability, health, environmental protection, technical compatibility and accessibility. (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1519999459620&amp;uri=CELEX:32016L0797)

Interoperability Saliency: The interoperability specification ABB is salient for legal interoperability because it establishes the normative statements for ensuring interoperability in public services. This ABB is salient for organizational interoperability by establishing the business principles to exchange data between public services. The Interoperability specification ABB is salient for semantic interoperability too in terms of identifying technical standards for the exchange of information between public services. And finally, the ABB is salient for technical interoperability due to it determines the technical requirements to implement the interoperability between public services.

Example: ICAO Service Level Agreement Template - A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an example of Interoperability Agreement in which parties agree on the description of the services to be provided by one or several parties to the other one(s). The SLA tackles topics like: service description, optional services, exclusions, limitations, service levels, service credits, escalation procedure, reporting and points of contact. (https://www.icao.int/ESAF/Documents/APIRG/APIRG18/Docs/wp17_appendices_en.pdf)

Interoperability Saliency: The Organisational Interoperability Agreement ABB is a key interoperability enabler (*) for governance and behavioural interoperability by (i) binding documents which set out the precise obligations of two parties cooperating across an ‘interface’ to achieve interoperability; (ii) enabling the collaborations and data flows established between the public digital services, and (iii) enabling digital business capabilities expected from the public digital services.

Additional information: (*)DECISION (EU) 2015/2240 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2015 establishing a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2 programme) as a means for modernising the public sector. The agreement should include purposes and goals, terms and conditions, governance, and the description of the channel(s). The EIRA© differentiates the following Interoperability Agreements: • Interoperability Service Agreement (between Public Service Consumers and Public Service Providers; • Interoperability Collaboration Agreement (between Organisations); or • Interoperability Provider Agreement (between Public Service Providers).

Interoperability saliency: The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is salient for the governance of interoperability because it lays the European framework between public administration to enable the interoperability between public services. The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is also salient for the legal interoperability due to the legal foundations and requirements that enable the seamless exchange of data, information, and knowledge between European and EEA Member State digital public services. The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is also salient for the organizational interoperability since, as a consequence of the agreement, digital business capabilities can be mapped and subsequently, the process can be aligned between the Member State and EEA Public Administrations and digital public services.

Interoperability Saliency: The Legal Act Representation ABB is salient for the Behavioural Interoperability because it enables the exchange, reading and processing of Legal Acts. It is also salient for the Structural Interoperability since the content digitally represented can be searched and reused in different domains and for differnt purposes.

Additional information: Legal Act Representation can be human or machine readable. In the context of digital public services they are, either way, digitally supported (i.e., no physical sypports like paper or other that are not bytes are involved in the exchange of data and information).

LDES provides a data publishing alternative based on Linked Data principles, that models dataset changes as a stream of events. This enables opportune data synchronization tasks and access to previous versions of dataset (historic data). In this pilot we aim to establish the foundations and show the benefits of the LDES approach, to power a specific use case required by ERA, namely the infrastructure change alert. https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/event/semic-linked-data-event-streams-pilot-era-9th-june

Consul&#xD;
Consul has multiple components, but as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in an infrastructure. It provides several key features:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Service Discovery: Clients of Consul can provide a service, such as api or mysql, and other clients can use Consul to discover providers of a given service. Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.&#xD;
•	Health Checking: Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service (&quot;is the webserver returning 200 OK&quot;), or with the local node (&quot;is memory utilization below 90%&quot;). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.&#xD;
•	KV Store: Applications can make use of Consul's hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.&#xD;
•	Multi Datacenter: Consul supports multiple datacenters out of the box. This means users of Consul do not have to worry about building additional layers of abstraction to grow to multiple regions.&#xD;

ePHOENIX&#xD;
epoline® PHOENIX (ePHOENIX) is a document and dossier management system designed to support the processes involved in the handling of Intellectual Property (IP)-related documents.&#xD;
The system, which was developed by the European Patent Office, allows IP offices to manage application dossiers in electronic form. It provides a means for scanning all incoming documents and a user interface to display the resulting electronic dossier on screen, as well as supporting the printing and distribution of work.&#xD;
ePHOENIX replaces physical paper files, thus removing the need for space-consuming archives and time-consuming transportation and management. Representing a further step towards the paperless office, the system improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness throughout the life-cycle of IP documents.&#xD;
ePHOENIX is highly configurable. It provides tools and interfaces which allow existing IT systems, organisational structures, working procedures and conventions to be retained. This means minimal development costs, minimal risk and maximum user acceptance. Furthermore, it is a flexible Java-based system that can operate in a wide variety of IT architectures.&#xD;
Thanks to its customisation possibilities, ePHOENIX can also be used to handle non-IP documents.&#xD;

OpenNebula&#xD;
The OpenNebula monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.&#xD;
OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.&#xD;

Log4j 2&#xD;
Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility, part of the Apache Logging Services project of the Apache Software Foundation. &#xD;
Log4j 1.x has been widely adopted and used in many applications. However, through the years development on it has slowed down. It has become more difficult to maintain due to its need to be compliant with very old versions of Java and became End of Life in August 2015. &#xD;
Improvements in Log4j 2:&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency than Log4j 1.x and Logback.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is garbage free for stand-alone applications, and low garbage for web applications during steady state logging. This reduces pressure on the garbage collector and can give better response time performance.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.&#xD;
•	Support for custom log levels. Custom log levels can be defined in code or in configuration.&#xD;
•	Support for Message objects. Messages allow support for interesting and complex constructs to be passed through the logging system and be efficiently manipulated. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 takes advantage of Java 5 concurrency support and performs locking at the lowest level possible. &#xD;
•	It is an Apache Software Foundation project following the community and support model used by all ASF projects. &#xD;

Camunda&#xD;
The core of Camunda BPM is a model execution engine that supports the OMG standards BPMN 2.0 for process automation, CMMN 1.1 for case management and DMN 1.1 for decision management.&#xD;
Camunda BPM ships with a set of applications to help you model, execute and administer process applications running on the Camunda core engine. Those applications interact with the core engine's public REST API. You can also create your own applications that may also use the core engine's public Java API. It is lightweight and requires less than 3MB of disk space. It can run in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and comes with extended integration for different runtime containers.&#xD;
The engine can be accessed via the REST API, or via the Java API and existing integrations with Spring and Java EE can be used. BPMN service tasks can be implemented in Java code, or the built-in REST and SOAP connectors can be used. Scripts, expressions and templates can also be applied for process implementation. Clustering for horizontal scalability is straightforward as the engine is stateless: multiple instances can share the same database.&#xD;
BPMN 2.0 Processes permits the fully automated service orchestration and human workflow management. &#xD;

ZooKeeper&#xD;
ZooKeeper is a centralized service registry for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.&#xD;

The OpenNebula monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.&#xD;
OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.&#xD;

Graylog2 - open source log management platform&#xD;
Graylog2 is an open source log management platform. Each message is saved in an Elasticsearch database and a web interface allows to manage and analyse the logs.&#xD;
Graylog2 is divided into two parts: graylog2-server and graylog2-web-interface. The first is a Java application that accepts messages on different protocols: UDP, TCP, GELF, AMQP... Each message is analysed and saved in the Elasticsearch database. A Rest API is also integrated into the tool and is used in particular by the web-interface part. This allows to manage users, streams and dashboards. &#xD;
Some possible uses: &#xD;
•	Centralization of the logs: several types of inputs: syslog, GELF, raw... Rather than having to connect to each of the servers to consult the error logs, they can be configured to send all the messages in Graylog2.&#xD;
•	Debug application&#xD;
•	Exception handling&#xD;
•	Log analysis&#xD;
For example, it can easily list the clients who are still using the deprecated version of an API. Another search can e.g. allow you to list the largest consumers or the most used parts of an API.&#xD;
Graylog Enterprise is built on top of the Graylog open source platform and offers additional features: &#xD;
•	Archiving: automatically archive the data that are not searched through very often. Store this data on more cost-effective, slower hard disks and make it available for search in Graylog only when needed.&#xD;
•	Audit Log: Graylog Enterprise also offers Audit Log capabilities. Audit Log records and stores actions taken by a user or administrator that make changes in the Graylog system.&#xD;

        <documentation>DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
Open data refers to the practice of publishing (raw) data in a way that is accessible, reusable, machine readable and licensed permissively. It can be generated by a wide range of parties, including public authorities, the semi-public sector, businesses and the public. In the case of public authorities, such as European Union organisations, making their data available for public reuse supports economic development, openness and transparency.&#xD;

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
The Open Data ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it is a part of the basic components of the EIF's conceptual model for integrated public services. Opening of public sector datasets for sharing and reuse is encouraged by the Directive on the reuse of public sector information, which provides a common legal framework for reuse of public sector data as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 2: &quot;Publish the data you own as open data unless certain restrictions apply.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
European Data Portal&#xD;
The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to:&#xD;
•	Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus.&#xD;
•	Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal.&#xD;
•	Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section.&#xD;
•	Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU's neighbourhood policy and Switzerland.&#xD;

DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS FOR REGISTRY SYSTEMS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS&#xD;
This section of the Technical Specifications addresses the messages and content requirements necessary to support submissions of unit transactions by registries and the validation of those transactions by the ITL. The unit transactions either involve the transfer of ownership of a unit, a change in an attribute of a unit, or the replacement of a tCER or lCER. This section will describe the data exchange flow, the responsibilities of registries, and the responsibilities of the ITL in order to complete a unit transaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
The following unit transactions are described:&#xD;
•	Issuance;&#xD;
•	Conversion;&#xD;
•	External Transfers;&#xD;
•	Cancellation (Internal Transfer);&#xD;
•	Replacement (Internal Transfer);&#xD;
•	Retirement (Internal Transfer);&#xD;

&#xD;
INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
The Base Registry ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it includes &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;. EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
EXAMPLES:&#xD;
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): &#xD;
&#xD;
Belgian national register&#xD;
&#xD;
The National Register refers to the information processing system which records, stores and communicates information relating to the identification of natural persons ie citizens.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is therefore a central database in which are recorded:&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing in Belgium;&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing abroad who register in the population registers held in Belgian diplomatic missions or consular posts abroad;&#xD;
•	all foreigners residing in Belgium who are admitted or authorized to settle or reside in the Kingdom;&#xD;
•	all foreigners (and their family members) who declare themselves refugees or who are seeking recognition of refugee status.&#xD;
&#xD;
The municipalities (and the Immigration Office for the last category of the population) are responsible for recording the information. As a pillar of e-government, the National Register ensures the sharing of authentic data identifying individuals between different public services with limited access to such data. The Sectorial Committee of the National Register established within the Commission for the Protection of Privacy is competent to authorize access to the information of the National Register or the communication thereof.&#xD;

Evidences are resources and can have associated metadata. The DCMI Type Vocabulary can be used for providing a list of evidences that can be submitted for satisfying a specific criterion.&#xD;
Note. Initially developed in 2002, the DCMI Type Vocabulary provides a general, cross-domain list of approved terms that may be used as values for the Type element to identify the genre of a resource. Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for content.&#xD;

EIRA concept: eira:ArchitectureBuildingBlock

ABB name: eira:SharedPlatformApplicationComponent

eira:iopSaliency: The Shared Platform ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it supports to achieve technical interoperability with public policy goals convergence value by  all in all enabling i) the provision/consumption of  back-office digital public services,  ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services and individuals , and iii) collaboration between digital public services.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Commission proposed a framework for a European Digital Identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents, and businesses in the EU. Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European Digital Identity wallets with the click of a button on their phone. They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe. Very large platforms will be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user, for example to prove their age.(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663)

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables: i) structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service); ii) behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and iii) governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements). Shared Platform offers a harmonised repository of business and technological resources that are essential for the dissemination of unique business functionalities. It is the cornerstone of a digital ecosystem, invariably interfacing with constituents through APIs or providing bespoke connectivity solutions like direct data access, thus ensuring that the organisation's digital fabric is both resilient and adaptive.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): eDelivery - Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents - eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.(https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery)

Interoperability Saliency: The e-Archiving Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the implementation of the functionalities for the long-term or permanent preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

Additional information: The EIRA© differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows: •	Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment; •	Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)); •	e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service”.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Form Tools - Form Tools is a forms framework written in PHP and MySQL. You download and install the script on your own website. At its heart, Form Tools is a web form creator, processor, data storage and access script. It was originally designed to work with any existing web form, but has since been expanded to create forms automatically as well. Form Tools is extremely versatile in how it integrates with your forms. You can use the bundled Form Builder module to create the forms automatically on your website (no programming or HTML skills necessary); you can use the PHP API to integrate your own custom form with the script; or you can simply POST your form to Form Tools, and just use it to store the form data. Anything goes! You can read about the different integration methods / form creation methods here. Form Tools works by creating custom database tables to store your unique form data. It provides a range of functionality customized to your data set, such as allowing you to view, update, cross-reference and export your submission data, create subsets of your data for viewing/editing by client accounts, data visualizations, and much more. https://formtools.org/

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Activiti - Activiti is an open-source workflow engine written in Java that can execute business processes described in BPMN 2.0. Activiti supports open standards such as BPMN and DMN with open REST APIs for demanding human- and system-centric processes. It provides business intelligence and audit logs features for free. And with building the solution on business processes, Activiti help to structure the software, think about user tasks, external systems and timers that need to be managed, think about transaction boundaries of the application. Building that kind of features becomes easier when structuring an application around a business process. Managing wait states, timers and asynchronous continuations becomes easier. A business process can express that structure more compact than working with the fundamental instruments that the Java platform offers like JDBC and JMS. Activiti also makes possible to link in Java or scripting for jobs. https://www.activiti.org/

Interoperability Saliency: The Orchestration Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides a set of various methods to manage existing business processes or define and establish new ones. BPM components also execute business process documented through accepted modelling techniques, as recommended by the EIF n.28: &quot;Document your business processes using commonly accepted modelling techniques and agree on how these processes should be aligned to deliver a European public service.&quot;

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Hibernate Validator - Express validation rules in a standardized way using annotation-based constraints and benefit from transparent integration with a wide variety of frameworks. Application layer agnostic validation: Hibernate Validator allows to express and validate application constraints. The default metadata source are annotations, with the ability to override and extend through the use of XML. It is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model and is available for both server and client application programming. Hibernate Validator presents the following characteristics: •	Extendable: Hibernate Validator offers a configurable bootstrap API as well as a range of built-in constraints. The latter can easily be extended by creating custom constraints; •	Rich metadata API: Hibernate Validator gives access to constraint configuration via a metadata API facilitating, for example, tooling integration; •	Reference implementation: Hibernate Validator 6.x is the reference implementation Bean Validation 2.0; •	Added value: Hibernate Validator offers additional value on top of the features required by Bean Validation. For example, a programmatic constraint configuration API as well as an annotation processor which plugs into the build process and raises compilation errors whenever constraint annotations are incorrectly used. http://hibernate.org/validator/

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Quality Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it allows the implementation of the functionality to validate if data received (or to be sent) is compliant with common and agreed interoperable formats as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 41: &quot;Establish procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in your common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems.&quot;

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Oracle Data Exchange - The Data Exchange Service provides several access points to the Event Repository, allowing the user to perform queries on these events: - The Query Subscription Administration Console configures the Data Exchange Service to create queries and periodically deliver query results to designated receivers (HTTP, JMS, and AS2). The Console can also test queries before subscribing, displaying user-readable events in XML format;  - A SOAP Web service allows programmatic queries. This SOAP service is based on the technically complete, but not formally ratified as of October 2006, EPCglobal EPC Information Services (EPCIS) Version 1.0 Specification.EPCglobal EPCIS 1.0 Working Draft. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13197_01/rfid/enterprise_server/docs20/epcis/data-exchange.html

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Management Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the share of data: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Interoperability Testbed - The Test Bed allows users to execute predefined test cases on their systems in order to test the conformance to standards and requirements, simulate a web-service, validate content and test a complete message exchange protocol. The Testbed manages test cases and users, and orchestrates domain-specific components, the domain-specific logic is in separate components that are used via web services. Test results are provided in a standardised, machine-readable format. The Test Bed also offers a test registry and repository (TRR) to store test artefacts (assertions, test cases, validation schemas, etc.) and compile test services (validation services, simulator services, etc.). Please visit the following website for more information: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/interoperability-test-bed_en

Interoperability Saliency: The Conformance Testing Services ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it enables the validation and verification that several solutions at one or more layers of the interoperability stack and they satisfy certain interoperability requirements.

Additional information: The logistics of interoperability testing is usually more costly (time, coordination, interoperability), and interoperability testing is no substitute for a conformance test suite. Experience shows that interoperability testing is more successful and less costly when conformance of implementations has been tested first.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): FPFIS-CMS: &quot;The European Commission announced in the Commission Internet strategy plans to transform the EUROPA web site from a source of one-way information into a tool for communication and interaction (i.e. provide modern interactive web sites for the citizens and stakeholders). Web sites are a key tool for external communications. They are the institution's business card. Websites are a very cost-effective and efficient means of communication. EUROPA now hosts over 460 websites. EUROPA would benefit from fewer and better sites to respond to user needs. To address the shortcomings, as part of the Commission's IT governance process, the College on 30 November 2011, instructed Commission departments to rationalise the Institution's web presence. Reduce the cost (human, financial, technical) of the Commission's web presence via exploiting economies of scale and eliminating redundancies by building corporate solutions. The European Commission should offer a corporate service which optimizes and harmonizes the use of different website tools, which speeds up the creation of new external dynamic and social websites (i.e. in days or weeks and not months) and which provides a common solid modern shared infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of these sites&quot;. https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/thinktank/index.php/Content_Management_System_of_the_Flexible_Platform

Interoperability Saliency: The Content Management Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionalities of dynamic creation, distribution and analysis of contents (images, videos, etc.) as stated in the EIF: &quot; Catalogues help others to find reusable resources (e.g. services, data, software, data models). Various types of catalogue exist, e.g. directories of services, libraries of software components, open data portals, registries of base registries, metadata catalogues, catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines. Commonly agreed descriptions of the services, data, registries and interoperable solutions published in catalogues are needed to enable interoperability between catalogues.&quot;

Additional information: Content Management ABB is an Application Service being responsible for: - developing Website templates and functionalities; - assigning appropriate user permissions and workflows; - providing trainings to the web working group; - developing tools and web controls to speed up and facilitate the work of the web working group; - giving support and advice to the web working group; - ensuring continuity of service and performance; - ensuring security and accessibility on the website; - ensuring disaster recovery processes and backup procedures; - setting up the website information architecture within the CMS; - setting up alert procedures and analytics on usage of the platform.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Virtuoso. Virtuoso Universal Server is modern platform built on existing open standards that harnesses the power of Hyperlinks (functioning as Super Keys) for breaking down data silos that impede both user and enterprise ability. For example, Virtuoso's core SQL &amp; SPARQL powers many Enterprise Knowledge Graph initiatives just as it does DBpedia and a majority of nodes in the Linked Open Data Cloud -- the world's largest publicly accessible Knowledge Graph. https://big-data-test-infrastructure.ec.europa.eu/service-offering/virtuoso_en

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Virtualization Application Service ABB is salient for technical interoperability because provides the tools for visualising datasets in a graphical way. These services can enable to visualise data and information from different sources, and public services, in a manner that can be better processed, understood, and therefore, interoperability can be achieved.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Oracle Data Exchange - The Data Exchange Service provides several access points to the Event Repository, allowing the user to perform queries on these events: - The Query Subscription Administration Console configures the Data Exchange Service to create queries and periodically deliver query results to designated receivers (HTTP, JMS, and AS2). The Console can also test queries before subscribing, displaying user-readable events in XML format; - A SOAP Web service allows programmatic queries. This SOAP service is based on the technically complete, but not formally ratified as of October 2006, EPCglobal EPC Information Services (EPCIS) Version 1.0 Specification.EPCglobal EPCIS 1.0 Working Draft. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13197_01/rfid/enterprise_server/docs20/epcis/data-exchange.html

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Management Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the share of data: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Eurostat transformation service - The transformation service allows datasets to be converted from one file format to another, optionally performing additional tasks, such as mapping and transcoding. The service is operational but is currently only available for internal consumption within Eurostat. However, the source code of both web service and software component is available in the SDMX webspace: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdmx-infospace/validation-transformation/transformation-services

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability  because it provides the functionalities to transform internal data structures to common and agreed interoperable formats as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 41: &quot;Establish procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in your common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems.&quot;

Synonym: Preservation Service

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eArchiving: eArchiving provides the core specifications, software, training and knowledge to tackle the challenge of short, medium and long-term data management and reuse in a sustainable, authentic, cost-efficient, manageable and interoperable way. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving

Interoperability Saliency: The e-Archiving Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the long-term or permanent preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

Additional information: The EIRA(c) differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows: - Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment; - Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)); - e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service”.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eSignature DSS - DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •	Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •	Interoperability of the e-signatures; •	Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •	Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •	Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •	Supports EU standards on: o	Signature formats and packaging methods;  o	Signature validation procedures; •	Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o	Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf

Interoperability Saliency: The e-Seal Preservation Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability  because it provides the functionalities required for e-seal preservation service.

Additional information: An ‘electronic seal' means data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter’s origin and integrity. The ‘creator of a seal’ is a legal person who creates an electronic seal.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eSignature DSS - DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •	Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •	Interoperability of the e-signatures; •	Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •	Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •	Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •	Supports EU standards on: o	Signature formats and packaging methods;  o	Signature validation procedures; •	Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o	Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): European Data Portal - The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included. What is Open Data? -	Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use; -	Public sector information is information held by the public sector. The Directive on the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data. It is built around the key pillars of the internal market: free flow of data, transparency and fair competition. It is important to note that not all of the public sector information is Open Data.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Fishcoin Project, is a project using Blockchain technologies for seafood traceability. https://fishcoin.co/

Interoperability Saliency: The Blockchain Application Service ABB is salient for interoperability because as a ledger technology application service can contribute to the trustability of digital public services. It can enable the register and list of irrevocable transactional data being exchanged between digital public services. To that extent, a blockchain service can be enhancing digital public services by establishing a mechanism to track data, and the process applied to it. 

Additional information: Specifically, Blockchain  stores records that contain a time stamp and reference links to previous transactions. With this information, anyone with access rights can trace back a transactional event, at any point in its history, belonging to any participant. A blockchain is one architectural design of the broader concept of distributed ledgers.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eSignature DSS - DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •	Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •	Interoperability of the e-signatures; •	Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •	Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •	Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •	Supports EU standards on: o	Signature formats and packaging methods;  o	Signature validation procedures; •	Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o	Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf

Interoperability Saliency: The e-Signature Creation Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the functionalities required for e-signature creation service.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): ZooKeeper - ZooKeeper is a centralized service registry for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed. https://zookeeper.apache.org/

Interoperability Saliency: The Service Registry ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it provides access to software systems over the Internet using standard protocols. In the most basic scenario there is a Web Service Provider that publishes a service and a Web Service Consumer that uses this service.

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Model ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it ensures compatible interpretations of data exchange as specified in the document &quot;Methodology and tools for metadata governance and management for EU Institutions&quot;, developed under the SEMIC action of the ISA Programme: &quot;Whilst technological developments offer various means to automate the exchange of information, technological developments alone cannot guarantee a greater interoperability between information systems. A fundamental aspect is the need for common data standards: primarily data models and reference data [...]&quot;.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): ESPD - Exchange data model - The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on &quot;the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7&quot;), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Microsoft Dynamics CRM Mapping Schema - Microsoft Dynamics CRM contains several data sets which comprise of different objects, such as Leads, Opportunities, and Competitors. Each of these data sets has several fields like Name, Account Owner, City, Country, Job Title, and more. The application has a defined schema along with attributes, enumerations, and mapping rules. Therefore, if a new record is to be added to the schema of a data object, a data map needs to be created from the data source to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM account.

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Mapping ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it supports to achieve legal behavioral interoperability by enabling the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services.

Additional information: Data mapping is used for a wide variety of tasks, including: - Data mediation between a data source and a destination; - Data transformation; - Identification of data relationships as part of data lineage analysis; - Discovery of hidden sensitive data such as the last four digits of a social security number hidden in another user id as part of a data masking or de-identification project; - Consolidation of multiple databases into a single database and identifying redundant columns of data for consolidation or elimination.

Universities ontologies can be view in university portals.(http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MEDDRA)

Interoperability Saliency: The Ontology ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it defined as a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that capture the fundamental characteristics of a data entity in a context-neutral and syntax-neutral fashion.

Additional information: Ontology ABB is a Data Object aiming to be a formal description of knowledge, as a set of concepts, within a domain and the axioms connecting concepts and allowing for logic inferences. When speaking about an ontology, we do not refer only to the terminology (or T-Box) but also to all the “assertions” about the concepts and roles (the A-Box), i.e. all the individuals or instances of concepts and roles of the terminology and as important, the rules for logic inference: the semantics “part&quot;.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): European Union Data Portal - The European Union Open Data Portal (EU ODP) gives you access to open data published by EU institutions and bodies. All the data you can find via this catalogue are free to use and reuse for commercial or non-commercial purposes. (https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset)

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Set ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it provides a collection of data to be shared or exchanged between ICT systmes as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 30: &quot;Perceive data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved.&quot;

Additional information: It is useful to remember that when a common interconnecting infrastructure for base registries is available, legislation is used to force its use. The use of interconnecting infrastructure prevents the proliferation of pointto-point interconnections. Stakeholders should be involved in developing the legislation and be given enough time to prepare for implementation.

EIRA concept: eira:ArchitectureBuildingBlock

ABB name: eira:SolutionBuildingBlockArtifact

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): TOLAR (https://tolar.io/)is a tool implemented as the outcome of the Seduproject, Hashnet is in the process of evaluation by the European Blockchain Partnership to become one of the pilot protocols for European Blockchain Service Infrastructure. https://www.seedeuproject.eu/partners/hashnet/

Interoperability Saliency: The Solution Building Block ABB is salient for the technical interoperability due to establishing the technical aspects related to the definition of architecture and public service architectural principles to support public administration in the service delivery.

Additional information: Solution Builsing Block ABB is formulated as an agreed normative statement in design terms on a legal, organisational, semantic, or technical attribute of an European Public Service. On the technical view, a Solution Building Block is a specific software component that it might be either procured or developed of a To-Be Interoperable European Solution or that it is integrated in an As-Is Interoperable European Solution

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): DIGIT/C Hosting Facility - DIGIT/C offers a high availability and high-performance hosting infrastructure that is comprised, among other elements, of back-end web server instances and application servers for hosting and serving both static and dynamic sites. The dynamic sites supported by the standard Apache web servers are mainly sites based on Coldfusion and in some cases also sites using CGI scripts. Dynamic sites based on particular technologies (i.e. Weblogic) are being hosted on individual application servers and are being integrated with the other related sites using reverse proxy mappings. Direct HTTP access to the back-end web servers hosting the static sites is denied by the standard web server configuration. http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/build/infrastructure/index_en.htm 

Interoperability Saliency: Hosting Facility ABB is salient for the technical interoperability because it establish the set up of IT systems to deliver the different public administration digital services and architectures that permit to integrate data from different infrastructure and remove existing IT silos in public administration.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Transparency: EIF Transparency Principle refers to: 1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, data, services and decision-making.  2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. 3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.(https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf)

Additional information: Public Policy Context is a specialisation of Public Policy Constraint. As such, Public Policy Context(s) provides the limits for the realisation of goals. In contrast to requirements, a Public Policy Constraint does not prescribe some intended functionality of the system to be realized but might impose restrictions on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used, such as the usage of open source software), a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or budget constraints), or a restriction on the functioning of the system (e.g., legal constraints).

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The European Cybersecurity Strategy has won a relevant role in the European IT environment since Ukraine's was started. Cybersecurity attacks have become a regular war method. Therefore, the context for the strength and increasing efforts by the Commission is this singular event.

      <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Achieve Semantic Interoperability ABB is a Goal. For the purpose of the EIF, interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.
The interoperability model which is applicable to all digital public services and may also be considered as an integral element of the interoperability-by-design paradigm. It includes: four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic and technical.

Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’. In the EIF, semantic interoperability covers both semantic and syntactic aspects.

Additional information: Data Protection Measures refer to the set of policies, procedures, and technologies that are implemented to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These measures are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, and to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Examples of data protection measures include encryption, access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, backup and recovery systems, and disaster recovery plans. The selection and implementation of data protection measures depend on the nature and sensitivity of the data, the risks and threats to the data, and the cost and feasibility of the measures.

Example: Data Protection Measures:
Decision: Implementing data encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.
Rationale: Data encryption helps safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and industry best practices.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Security testing is a critical aspect of IT architecture decision-making. It involves the evaluation of a system's security measures to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats. The goal of security testing is to ensure that the system is secure and protected from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks. The testing process involves a range of techniques, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and risk assessment. By conducting security testing, IT architects can identify weaknesses in the system and take steps to address them, thereby improving the overall security posture of the organization.

Example: Security Testing:
Decision: Conducting regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments on the system.
Rationale: Regular security testing helps identify and address vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system, reducing the risk of exploitation by attackers. It ensures the ongoing security and resilience of the system.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a concept in IT architecture that provides a method for controlling access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. This approach is designed to simplify the process of managing access to sensitive data and systems by assigning permissions based on job responsibilities rather than individual identities. With RBAC, administrators can create roles that define specific access privileges and then assign those roles to users based on their job functions. This helps to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their duties, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. RBAC is widely used in enterprise environments and is considered a best practice for access control in IT security.

Example: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Decision: Implementing RBAC to enforce fine-grained access controls based on user roles and permissions.
Rationale: RBAC provides a structured and manageable approach to access control, ensuring that users have appropriate privileges based on their roles within the system, minimizing the risk of unauthorized actions.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The application of service monitoring tools is a decision in IT architecture that involves the use of software tools to monitor and manage the performance of IT services. These tools are designed to provide real-time visibility into the performance of IT systems, applications, and infrastructure, allowing IT teams to quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact end-users. Service monitoring tools typically include features such as performance monitoring, event management, and alerting, which enable IT teams to proactively manage and optimize IT services. By using these tools, IT teams can improve service availability, reduce downtime, and enhance the overall user experience. The decision to implement service monitoring tools requires careful consideration of factors such as the organization's IT infrastructure, the complexity of its IT services, and the level of support required. It also involves selecting the right tools that are compatible with the organization's existing IT systems and can provide the necessary level of visibility and control. 

Example: Network Optimization:
Decision: Set-up a monitoring tool (like Prometheus or similar).
Rationale: Since there will be multiple services deployed in the Operate First environment (ex. Jupyterhub, Argo, Superset, Observatorium, etc) distributed over various namespaces, we need to be able to monitor them.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The concept of Provide a Service Catalog in IT architecture decision-making involves creating a comprehensive list of all the services that an organization offers to its customers or clients. This catalog provides a clear and concise description of each service, including its features, benefits, and pricing. By having a service catalog, customers can easily find the services they need and understand what they are getting. It also helps organizations to manage their services more efficiently, prioritize their resources, and make informed decisions about service offerings. The service catalog can be made available online or in print, and it can be updated regularly to reflect changes in the organization's services.

Example: Decision: Chosen option: &quot;Backstage&quot;, because we don't want to reimplement the tooling, we want something opensource and Backstage is now a CNCF project.
Rationale: As a transparent and open  cloud we need a simple yet complete way of displaying services that are available on our platform, their current status, support path etc.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The Application of Service Monitoring Tools Configuration concept refers to the process of configuring service monitoring tools to ensure that they can effectively monitor and manage the performance of IT services. This involves setting up the tools to collect data on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, availability, and throughput, and configuring alerts and notifications to ensure that IT teams are alerted to any issues that arise. The goal of this concept is to enable IT teams to proactively identify and address issues before they impact end-users, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of IT services.

Example: Network Optimization:
Decision: The GitHub alertmanager receiver can easily be configured and operated to function with Prometheus alerts. It automatically creates issues in GitHub repositories for any active alerts being fired, making it visible for any user to track
All communication/updates/concerns related to the incident can be easily handled by adding comments in the issues created by the GitHub receiver
Unlike Option 1, there is no additional cost involved
There is no requirement for using JIRA/Slack for incident tracking, which are the only supported options in some of the tools listed in Option 2 (such as Dispatch and Response) In any case that such a requirement surfaces, we can use GitHub bots for different platforms such as GitHub for Slack and Google Chat to notify us of the issues immediately
It is actively being maintained and supported compared to some of the tools in Option 1 (such as Cabot and OpenDuty) which lack community support
Rationale: As we have multiple services/applications deployed and monitored in the Operate First environment (ex. Jupyterhub, Argo, Superset, Observatorium, Project Thoth, AICoE CI pipelines etc), we need to implement an incident reporting setup for handling outages/incidents related to these services.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Cross-border Semantic Data Management is a concept that refers to the management of data across different countries or regions, with a focus on ensuring that the data is consistent and understandable across all borders. This involves the use of semantic technologies, which allow for the creation of a common language or vocabulary that can be used to describe data in a way that is easily understood by all parties involved. The goal of cross-border semantic data management is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data sharing and collaboration across different regions, while also ensuring that the data remains secure and protected. This concept is particularly important in today's globalized economy, where businesses and organizations often need to work together across borders to achieve their goals.

Example: Decision: Data provider discovery and (semantic) data management capabilities  are both operated by the same entity, with the role of Cross-Border Data Exchange.
Consequence: Cross-Border Data Management is a new business role.

Additional information: Access Control Policy is a critical concept in IT architecture that defines the rules and guidelines for controlling access to resources and data within an organization's network. It outlines the procedures and protocols that must be followed to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information and resources. The policy includes guidelines for user authentication, authorization, and access management, and it helps organizations to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data. The Access Control Policy is a crucial component of any IT security program, and it is essential for protecting against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber attacks.

Example: Access Control Policies:
Decision: Enforcing role-based access control (RBAC) and implementing strict access control policies for government systems.
Rationale: RBAC provides a structured approach to managing user access based on predefined roles and responsibilities, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Asynchronous Processing is a concept in IT architecture that involves executing tasks or processes independently of each other, without waiting for the completion of one task before starting another. This approach allows for greater efficiency and scalability, as multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously without causing delays or bottlenecks. Asynchronous processing is commonly used in web applications, where multiple users may be accessing the same system at the same time, and in distributed systems, where tasks may be spread across multiple servers or nodes. It is also used in event-driven architectures, where processes are triggered by specific events or messages. Overall, asynchronous processing is a key component of modern IT architectures, enabling faster, more efficient, and more scalable systems.

Example: Decision: Integrating Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for processing large volumes of data in near real-time.
Rationale: Kafka allows for the ingestion of high-volume data streams, while Spark provides a distributed processing framework for performing complex analytics and transformations on the data.

      <documentation>Definition: Architecture Decision Record from where you should specialise the ADR SBBs regarding the Managing Self-Description Schemas in the Federated Catalogue

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The concept of Managing Self-description Schemas in the Federated Catalogue involves the creation and management of metadata that describes the data and services available in a federated environment. This metadata is used to enable discovery, understanding, and use of the data and services by users and applications. The self-description schemas provide a standardized way of describing the data and services, which makes it easier for users to find and use them. The federated catalogue is a central repository that stores the metadata and provides a search interface for users to discover the data and services. Effective management of self-description schemas in the federated catalogue is essential for ensuring that the data and services are discoverable, understandable, and usable by users and applications.

Example: Decision: Self-Descriptions refer to one or several schemas via a &quot;isA&quot; relation.
Every schema consists of classes and classes define attributes and relations to other Self-Descriptions.
Only attributes from a class can be used for the Self-Descriptions.
The Self-Description classes form an extensible inheritance hierarchy.
For example geo-location for some Nodes.
The Self-Description classes are versioned according to the Semantic Versioning conventions.
GAIA-X provides and maintains a set of core Self-Description classes.
The schema hierarchy can be extended with specialized classes, for example for a domain-specific ecosystem.
GAIA-X defines requirements and processes to accept and distribute new Self-Description classes and updates thereof.
- Option 1: Central repo by the GAIA-X Foundation for schemas
- Option 2: Ecosystems / private catalogues can have additional schema sources
RDF and SHACL are selected as technologies for schema description and enforcement.
- RDF: Data model &quot;behind&quot; JSON-LD
- SHACL: Validation of RDF against a schema independently from the serialization technology
Rationale: For the purpose of validating Self-Descriptions, the Federated Catalogue needs to know the Schema to validate against.
Gaia-X develops an extensible hierarchy of Schemas that define the terms used in Self-Descriptions.
Some Schemas are standardized by the Gaia-X AISBL and must be supported by any Catalogue, but it should be possible to create additional ones specific to an application domain, an Ecosystem, Participants in it, or Assets offered by these Participants.
Schemas have the same format as Self-Descriptions, i.e., they are graphs in the RDF data model, serialized as JSON-LD.
A Schema may define terms (classes, their attributes, and their relationships to other classes) in an Ontology.
If it does, it must also define Shapes to validate instances of the Ontology against.
A Schema may also introduce a Controlled Vocabulary of attribute values intended to be reused.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: API design is a crucial aspect of IT architecture decision-making, as it determines how different software systems and applications communicate with each other. A well-designed API can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development, as it allows developers to easily integrate different systems and functionalities. On the other hand, a poorly designed API can lead to compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and other problems that can hinder the development process. Therefore, IT architects must carefully consider the design of APIs when making decisions about software development and integration. This includes factors such as the format and structure of the API, the security measures in place, and the ease of use for developers.

Example: One example of the application of the Directive 2014/24/EU is in the procurement of construction services for a new public building. The directive requires that the procurement process be open, transparent, and non-discriminatory, with equal opportunities for all potential bidders. The contracting authority must publish a notice of the procurement in the Official Journal of the European Union, and provide all relevant information to interested parties. The directive also requires that the contracting authority evaluate bids based on objective criteria, and award the contract to the most economically advantageous tender. This ensures that public funds are used efficiently and effectively, and that the public receives high-quality services at a fair price.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Authentication Mechanism is a crucial concept in IT architecture that refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or system before granting access to resources or services. It involves the use of various methods such as passwords, biometric identification, smart cards, and tokens to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information or perform critical operations. The choice of authentication mechanism depends on the level of security required, the complexity of the system, and the user experience. A well-designed authentication mechanism can prevent unauthorized access, protect against cyber threats, and enhance the overall security of the IT infrastructure.

Example: Authentication Mechanism:
Decision: Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
Rationale: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. TOTP is a widely supported and secure method for generating one-time passwords.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Digital Agenda for Europe. See https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe. The widespread, rapid and extensive development of digital service platforms, as well as debates on public data spaces and new technologies such as artificial intelligence, affect all areas of our society. Many new ways to communicate, shop or access information online have been integrated into our daily lives and are constantly evolving. The European digital agenda for the decade 2020-2030 addresses these issues by focusing on creating secure digital spaces and services, creating a level playing field in digital markets with large platforms and strengthening Europe’s digital sovereignty, while contributing to the European goal of climate neutrality by 2050.

Interoperability Saliency: The Digital Agenda ABB is salient for governance interoperability since it establishes the main goals and priorities that the digital public services are expected to support (e.g., the overall aim of the Digital Agenda is to deliver sustainable economic and social benefits from a digital single market based on fast and ultra-fast internet and interoperable applications).

Additional information: Do not confuse Digital Agenda with Digitalisation Roadmap. An Agenda focuses on goals and priorities, e.g. protecting citizens and freedoms, developing a strong and vibrant economic base, building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe, promoting European interests and values on the global stage, etc. A Roadmap focuses on the actions and deadlines that need to be executed to realise the Agenda.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The Security Incident Response concept involves the development of a comprehensive plan to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents that may occur within an organization's information systems. The plan should include procedures for identifying and assessing potential threats, as well as protocols for containing and mitigating the impact of any incidents that do occur. The goal of the Security Incident Response concept is to minimize the risk of data loss, system downtime, and other negative consequences that can result from security breaches. Effective implementation of this concept requires ongoing monitoring and testing of security measures, as well as regular training and awareness programs for employees.

Example: Security Incident Response:
Decision: Establishing an incident response plan to handle security breaches and incidents.
Rationale: Having a well-defined incident response plan enables a quick and coordinated response to security incidents, minimizing potential damage, and facilitating the recovery and restoration of normal operations.

Additional information: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver content to end-users. The concept of a CDN is to reduce the latency and improve the performance of websites and applications by caching content closer to the end-users. This is achieved by replicating the content across multiple servers in different geographic locations, allowing users to access the content from the server closest to them. CDNs are commonly used for delivering static content such as images, videos, and other media files. They can also be used for dynamic content such as web applications and APIs. CDNs can improve website performance, reduce server load, and provide better user experience.

Example: Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Decision: Utilizing a CDN to distribute static content and media files closer to end-users.
Rationale: A CDN improves performance by caching and delivering content from edge servers located in various geographic regions, reducing latency and improving the overall user experience.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Database sharding ADR is a decision to choose the technique used in distributed databases to improve scalability and performance. It involves partitioning a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, which are distributed across multiple servers. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and queries are routed to the appropriate shard based on a predefined sharding key. This allows for faster query processing and reduces the risk of data loss or downtime in the event of a server failure. However, implementing database sharding requires careful planning and coordination to ensure data consistency and availability.

Example: Database Sharding:
Decision: Implementing database sharding to distribute data across multiple database instances.
Rationale: Sharding allows for horizontal scaling of the database by splitting data into smaller partitions and distributing them across multiple database servers, improving performance and accommodating increased data volume.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: The decision to use GNU GPL as a license concept is a strategic choice made by companies and organizations that want to promote the use and distribution of open-source software. The GNU GPL license allows users to modify and distribute the software freely if they also make their modifications available under the same license. This creates a collaborative environment where developers can work together to improve the software and build upon each other's work. Additionally, the GNU GPL license ensures that the software remains open-source and free for all to use, preventing any one entity from monopolizing the technology.

Example: Internationalization and Localization:
Decision: Chosen option: &quot;GNU GPL&quot;, because this license supports a strong copyleft model.
Rationale: Everything needs to be licensed, otherwise the default copyright laws apply. For instance, in Germany that means users may not alter anything without explicitly asking for permission. For more information see https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/.

We want to have all source code related to Operate First to be used without any hassle and as free as possible, so that users can just execute and enjoy the four freedoms.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Database Schema Design is an important decision in IT architecture that involves creating a logical representation of the database structure. It involves defining the tables, columns, relationships, and constraints that make up the database. The schema design should be optimized for the specific needs of the application and should be flexible enough to accommodate future changes. A well-designed schema can improve performance, reduce data redundancy, and ensure data integrity. It is important to consider factors such as scalability, security, and data access when making database schema design decisions.

Example: Database Schema Design:
Decision: Utilizing a denormalized schema design for a reporting database to optimize query performance.
Rationale: Denormalizing the schema reduces the need for joins and improves query performance for reporting and analytics use cases, at the expense of increased data redundancy.

Achieve Organisational Interoperability ABB is Goal. For the purpose of the EIF, interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.
The interoperability model which is applicable to all digital public services and may also be considered as an integral element of the interoperability-by-design paradigm. It includes: four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic and technical.

Organisational interoperability refers to the way in which public administrations align their business processes, responsibilities and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals. In practice, organisational interoperability means documenting and integrating or aligning business processes and relevant information exchanged. Organisational interoperability also aims to meet the requirements of the user community by making services available, easily identifiable, accessible and user-focused.

Additional information: The Semantic Capability concept in IT architecture refers to the ability of a system or application to understand and interpret the meaning of data and information. This involves the use of semantic technologies such as ontologies, taxonomies, and metadata to provide context and structure to data, enabling better search, retrieval, and analysis. Semantic Capability is important in enabling interoperability between different systems and applications, as well as in supporting advanced analytics and decision-making processes. It is also a key enabler of the semantic interoperability, which aims to make data more accessible and useful by adding meaning and context to it.

Source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022

Source reference: https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html

Additional information: Caching strategy is a concept in IT architecture that involves the use of caching mechanisms to improve the performance of applications and systems. Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in a cache, which is a temporary storage area that is closer to the application or system than the original data source. This reduces the time it takes to access the data, thereby improving the overall performance of the application or system. 

Example: Caching Mechanism:
Decision: Implementing a distributed caching mechanism, such as Redis or Memcached, to improve response times and reduce database load.
Rationale: Caching frequently accessed data in memory reduces the need for repeated database queries, resulting in faster response times, improved scalability, and reduced strain on the database infrastructure.

Additional information: Cross-border data exchange is a concept that refers to the transfer of data between different countries or regions. This can be done for various reasons, such as sharing information between businesses, governments, or individuals. The concept of cross-border data exchange is becoming increasingly important in today's globalized world, as more and more organizations are operating across borders and need to share information with partners and customers in different countries. However, there are also challenges associated with cross-border data exchange, such as data privacy and security concerns, legal and regulatory issues, and technical compatibility issues. Therefore, it is important for organizations to carefully consider the IT architecture decisions related to cross-border data exchange and ensure that they have appropriate policies, procedures, and technologies in place to manage these challenges effectively.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): In 2021-2027 EU cohesion policy has set a shorter, modern menu of 5 policy objectives supporting growth for the period 2021-2027. The Joint Action Plan includes actions on: 1. a more competitive and smarter Europe; 2. a greener, low carbon transitioning towards a net zero carbon economy; 3. a more connected Europe by enhancing mobility; 4. a more social and inclusive Europe; 5. Europe closer to citizens by fostering the sustainable and integrated development of all types of territories (https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/2021-2027_en)

Interoperability Saliency: The Public Policy Objective ABB is salient for the governance of interoperability because it sets the path toward the definition of courses of action and frameworks that facilitates data sharing across EU countries. This ABB also is salient for legal interoperability due to it will drive the specification of legal requirements for the enablement of interoperability.

Additional information: Public Policy Objectives are usually formalized in the legislation. Thus, the EU data strategy is supported by a catalogue of legislation comprising the Data Act (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act), the Data Governance Act (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767), the Interoperable Europe Act (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022PC0720), and other ancillary binding legal instruments like the GDPR, eIDAS, the framework for the flow of non-personal data, as well as by non-binding instruments like the Communication of the Commission on a European data space (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A52018DC0232)

European Commission cloud strategy: &quot;Cloud-first with a secure hybrid multi-cloud service offering&quot;. Cloud-first means that systems should rather be conceived in such a way that they can benefit from the advantages of cloud based delivery models, which exist both on premise and in the public cloud. The choice of architecture, especially of on premise and/or public cloud, will depend on the advantages, constraints and risks for a specific system.

Loosely coupled organisations are able to function with minimal dependency on other organisations. This enables faster implementation and change of digital public services. Any public organisation should avoid the entanglement of inter-organisational processes for performing activities, that spread over multiple organisations. The application for a visa, for instance, should be performed in a single transaction, from an applicants perspective. Whether the process comprises multiple interactions between public institutions (like Frontex, Embassy, Interpol) or not, should be transparent to the applicant. Inter-organisational interfaces in this case should not duplicate the processes, using the same data and leading to the same outcome. Each organisation serves a unique part of the application process. Loosely coupled integration can be achieved by establishing the proper organisational agreements, that ensure the proper implementation of digital public services without hampering any change or modification in those services. At technical and semantic layers, it can be achieved by reusing existing application services or core vocabularies that ensure interoperability between services without including dependencies between them. &quot;&quot;"/>

Title: Consumer protection

Example: An example of the application of consumer protection in data sharing is when a company collects personal data from its customers for marketing purposes. The company must inform the customers about the specific purposes for which their data will be used, obtain their explicit consent, and provide them with the option to opt-out of such data sharing. Additionally, the company must ensure the security and confidentiality of the data and allow customers to access, correct, or delete their personal information upon request.

Additional information: Consumer protection is a fundamental aspect of data sharing in the European Union. It is based on the principles outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant legislation. The principle emphasizes the importance of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality in protecting the rights of individuals. It also highlights the need for organizations to implement appropriate security measures and provide individuals with mechanisms to exercise their rights, such as the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data.

Title: Citizen Participation

Example: An example of Citizen Participation in practice is when a city government initiates a public consultation process to gather input from residents on the use of data collected through smart city sensors. Citizens are invited to provide feedback, express concerns, and suggest potential uses for the data. This participatory approach allows the city to make informed decisions that reflect the needs and preferences of its citizens, ensuring that data sharing initiatives are transparent, accountable, and beneficial to the community as a whole.

Additional information: Citizen Participation promotes the active engagement of individuals, communities, and civil society organizations in shaping data sharing policies, frameworks, and practices. It aims to foster trust, promote inclusivity, and empower citizens to have a say in how their data is collected, used, and shared. By involving citizens, data sharing initiatives can better address societal needs, protect privacy rights, and ensure that data-driven decisions align with public interests.

It may seem that the costs of building new IT systems can be acceptable, but the costs of the maintenance and support of these systems are often forgotten and are much higher than the cost related to the initial development. When requirements for IT support arise, it is first determined whether systems that provide similar functionality are already available in the organization or otherwise in the market.Requirements that are not supported by existing systems are critically analyzed to determine whether they are really essential.Processes are adapted to existing systems or standard systems that are available in the market, when possible and acceptable.Building new IT systems is only considered a last resort when no existing systems exist or cannot fulfil essential requirements.&quot;&quot;"/>

Title: Self Determination

Example: An example of self-determination in practice is when an individual is presented with clear and understandable choices regarding the collection and use of their personal data. For instance, a website may provide options for users to opt-in or opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising or sharing data with third parties. By giving individuals the ability to exercise their self-determination, they can make informed decisions about their data and protect their privacy.

Additional information: Self-determination is a fundamental aspect of data protection and privacy rights. It ensures that individuals have the ability to exercise control over their personal data, including the right to provide or withhold consent for data processing activities. This principle is enshrined in various European data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which grants individuals the right to be informed, access, rectify, and erase their personal data. Self-determination also includes the right to object to data processing, restrict processing, and the right to data portability.

Additional information: Security by design encompasses the protection of valuable assets, by securing them safely within the boundaries of organizations, taking into account the ownership of the assets. This means that in any circumstance, one has to attend to the valuable property, being 'data' and 'technology' as a whole, both by securing access to (data)assets and by securing the proliferation of data(assets) outside the boundaries, for which one is responsible.

Security by design (or secure by design), sometimes abbreviated “SbD,” is a new industry term for a range of security practices built on one fundamental idea — that security should be built into a product by design, instead of being added on later by third-party products and services. 
The European Interoperability Framework is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.

Example: An example of the application of the Inclusion principle is the creation of open data portals by governments, where they make various datasets available to the public, researchers, and businesses. These portals ensure that data is accessible to anyone interested, enabling the development of innovative applications, research studies, and informed policy-making. Additionally, initiatives promoting data sharing among different organizations, such as public-private partnerships, adhere to the principle of inclusion by allowing equal participation and access to shared data resources.

Additional information: Inclusion in data sharing is crucial for fostering innovation, enabling fair competition, and driving societal benefits. It ensures that data is not monopolized by a few entities and encourages collaboration and participation from diverse stakeholders. By promoting inclusivity, the European Data Sharing principle aims to create a level playing field and empower all actors to leverage data for economic growth, scientific advancements, and evidence-based decision-making.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): ELAP transparency principle in the EIF context refers to: Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens, and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, 11 data, services, and decision-making. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations. https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/common-assessment-method-standards-and-specifications-camss/solution/elap/distribution/elap-catalogue-v100xlsx

Interoperability Saliency: The European Library of Architecture Principles (ELAP) ABB is salient for governance interoperability due to it establishes the principles and framework to ensure interoperability at the European level. Also, the European Library of Architecture Principles ABB is salient for organizational interoperability due to it establishes requirements and business processes to enable interoperability between public services.

Additional information: The European Library of Architecture Principles (ELAP) ABB is a set of principles intended to direct government organizations in initiating changes and implementing IT projects. Particularly when designing new or modified services, it is necessary to make visible how the principles are implemented and which considerations are made in this regard. The apply-or-explain principle applies here, whereby deviations are permitted provided that they are substantiated and recorded with good arguments so that they can be revisited at a later stage. This prevents important matters from being overlooked.

Source reference: https://ec.europa.eu/

Additional information: The European Data Sharing Principles were developed in alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws. They emphasize the importance of transparency, legal compliance, and accountability when sharing data. The principles encourage organizations to adopt fair and non-discriminatory data sharing practices, implement appropriate security measures, and establish clear governance frameworks for data sharing initiatives. By following these principles, the European Union seeks to create a data-sharing ecosystem that benefits both businesses and individuals while maintaining high standards of data protection.

Example: An example application of the European Data Sharing Principles is a consortium of healthcare providers sharing anonymized patient data for medical research purposes. The principles ensure that the data is handled securely and in compliance with data protection laws. The healthcare providers implement technical measures to de-identify the data, establish data access controls, and define data usage agreements. Researchers can then access the shared data for scientific studies while protecting patient privacy and maintaining the trust of the individuals whose data is being shared.

      <documentation>Definition: A full life cycle cost of ownership (including retirement costs) should form part of the business case. At a critical stage for sustainable development in terms of climate change, and excess use of resources (economic, natural resources, etc), there is a need for the public administrations to use and establish relevant policies that help the reduction of general waste. Public administrations are the first link of the chain and need to be the example for society and businesses on taking care of the whole life cycle for technology products. Therefore, when planning and designing public services, this aspect needs to be included (from the design and implementation to the retirement) When implementing and retiring elements related to the provision of digital public services, public administrations shall include and create policies that ensure the lifecycle of infrastructures, applications services and equipment, is considered and extended to ensure the minimum waste in terms of sustainability.

Title: Care from cradle to grave

Additional information: At a critical stage for sustainable development in terms of climate change, and excess use of resources (economic, natural resources, etc), there is a need for the public administrations to use and establish relevant policies that help the reduction of general waste. 

Public administrations are the first link of the chain and need to be the example for society and businesses on taking care of the whole life cycle for technology products. Therefore, when planning and designing public services, this aspect needs to be included (from the design and implementation to the retirement)

Being user-centred or remaining \&quot;user-led,\&quot; is possible with a service-oriented strategy. It entails offering services that employ the best technological solutions to provide better results. By making this change, the organization will put user demands and goals at the centre of its vision, culture, and operations. After then, make sure that everyone supports it and owns it so that decisions and technology are driven by user demands.A service-oriented strategy entails developing an IT platform made up of numerous systems, each one tailored to carry out particular tasks. You can change one aspect of a systems functionality with a tech stack made up of separate components without changing the operation of the entire system. Certain components can be digitalized more quickly because of this function fragmentation, which also offers a distribution strategy that allows for independently distributed functions. Communication with external programs is also made possible by separate systems where each software tool is designed to carry out a specific task using a well-defined interface.There are a variety of technologies that can be applied to this service orientation approach such as SOAP, REST API and GraphQL.  At the organisational level, public administrations need to establish the proper agreements that allow collaboration and common mechanisms to provide relevant information through the desired Service Oriented Architecture. At the technical level, the organisations in charge of implementing and delivery of digital public services will need to determine which is the best approach to fit their needs. There are different approaches such as SAP, RESTApi or GraphQL, taking into account the relevant aspects of the services, the organisation responsible for the service should select the more sustainable and efficient way of implementing the SOA approach. &quot;&quot;"/>

      <documentation>Definition: Archivability is an IT non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to store and retrieve data or information over a long period of time. This requirement is important for systems that deal with critical data or information that needs to be preserved for legal, regulatory, or historical purposes. Archivability ensures that data is stored in a format that can be accessed and retrieved easily, even after a long period of time, and that the data remains accurate and complete. It also ensures that the system can handle large amounts of data and that the data is stored securely to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

Additional information: Archivability is a non-functional requirement that pertains to the ability of a system to store and preserve data for future reference or use. According to the TOGAF specification, guidelines, and documentation, archivability is a critical aspect of enterprise architecture, particularly in the context of data management and governance.

The archivability non-functional requirement is closely related to other requirements such as data retention, data integrity, and data security. It involves ensuring that data is stored in a format that is easily retrievable and accessible, and that it remains intact and uncorrupted over time. This requirement is particularly important for organizations that are required to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, as it ensures that data can be retrieved and presented as evidence if necessary.

To meet the archivability non-functional requirement, enterprise architects must consider a range of factors, including the type of data being stored, the format in which it is stored, the storage medium used, and the length of time for which the data needs to be retained. They must also consider the potential risks associated with data loss or corruption, and implement appropriate measures to mitigate these risks.

In practice, meeting the archivability non-functional requirement may involve implementing a range of technologies and processes, such as data backup and recovery systems, data archiving solutions, and data retention policies. It may also involve working closely with stakeholders across the organization to ensure that data is managed and stored in a way that meets their needs and requirements.

Overall, the archivability non-functional requirement is a critical aspect of enterprise architecture, and one that must be carefully considered and managed to ensure the long-term viability and success of an organization.

Example: Archivability: The system must be able to store and retrieve data for a minimum of 10 years, with the ability to export data in a standard format for long-term storage and retrieval.

      <documentation>Definition: Fault tolerance is an IT non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning even in the event of hardware or software failures. This means that the system should be able to detect and recover from errors or failures without causing any disruption to the user experience. Fault tolerance is important for critical systems that cannot afford to fail, such as those used in healthcare, finance, and transportation. It involves redundancy, backup systems, and failover mechanisms to ensure that the system remains operational even in the face of unexpected events.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, fault tolerance is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to continue operating in the event of a failure or error. This means that the system should be able to detect and recover from faults or errors without causing any disruption to the overall performance or availability of the system.

To achieve fault tolerance, the system should be designed with redundancy and failover mechanisms that can automatically switch to backup components or systems in the event of a failure. This can include redundant hardware components, such as servers, storage devices, and network connections, as well as software components, such as load balancers, clustering, and replication.

In addition, the system should be able to detect faults and errors in real-time, using monitoring and alerting mechanisms that can notify system administrators or operators of any issues. This can include automated monitoring tools that can detect performance issues, security breaches, or other types of errors that can impact the system's availability or performance.

Overall, fault tolerance is a critical non-functional requirement for any system that requires high availability and reliability, such as mission-critical applications, financial systems, or healthcare systems. By designing systems with fault tolerance in mind, organizations can ensure that their systems can continue operating even in the face of unexpected failures or errors, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Fault tolerance' is in the aviation industry. The flight control systems of an aircraft must be designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning that they can continue to operate even if one or more components fail. This is critical for ensuring the safety of passengers and crew in the event of a system failure. The system must be able to detect and isolate faults, and then continue to operate using redundant components or backup systems.

      <documentation>Definition: Availability is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system or application to be accessible and operational at all times. It is a measure of the system's reliability and the ability to provide uninterrupted service to users. This requirement is critical for systems that are used in mission-critical environments, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. High availability is achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery mechanisms that ensure that the system can continue to function even in the event of hardware or software failures.

Source: TOGAF

Source reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap03.html

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, Availability is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system or application to be accessible and usable by authorized users at all times. This requirement is critical for ensuring that the system or application is always available for use, regardless of any potential disruptions or failures.

To meet the Availability requirement, the system or application must be designed and implemented with a high degree of resilience, fault tolerance, and redundancy. This may involve the use of redundant hardware, software, and network components, as well as the implementation of backup and recovery procedures to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a failure.

Additionally, the system or application must be designed to handle high levels of traffic and usage, without experiencing performance degradation or downtime. This may involve the use of load balancing and other performance optimization techniques to ensure that the system can handle peak loads without impacting availability.

Overall, the Availability requirement is critical for ensuring that the system or application is always accessible and usable by authorized users, and must be carefully considered and addressed during the design and implementation phases of the project.

Example: One example of an IT non-functional requirement for availability could be for a banking system to have a 99.99% uptime, meaning that the system should be available for use by customers 99.99% of the time. This requirement ensures that customers can access their accounts and perform transactions at any time without experiencing downtime or system failures.

      <documentation>Definition: Scalability is an important non-functional requirement for any IT system, which refers to the ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of workload or users without compromising its performance or stability. A scalable system should be able to accommodate growth in data volume, traffic, and user base, by adding more resources or nodes to the system, without causing any downtime or degradation in response time. Scalability is critical for ensuring that the system can meet the demands of the business, adapt to changing requirements, and provide a seamless user experience.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, scalability is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work or traffic without experiencing a decrease in performance or stability. This requirement is important for systems that are expected to grow or expand over time, as it ensures that the system can handle the increased workload without compromising its functionality or reliability.

Scalability can be achieved through a variety of techniques, including horizontal scaling (adding more servers or nodes to distribute the workload), vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server or node), and load balancing (distributing the workload across multiple servers or nodes). It is important to consider scalability early in the design process, as it can impact the overall architecture and infrastructure of the system.

To ensure that scalability is achieved, it is important to establish performance metrics and benchmarks, and to regularly test and monitor the system to identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Additionally, the system should be designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, so that it can be easily adapted and expanded as needed.

Overall, scalability is a critical non-functional requirement for any system that is expected to grow or evolve over time, and should be carefully considered and addressed in the design and implementation phases of the system development lifecycle.

Example: An example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Scalability' could be a web application that needs to handle a large number of concurrent users. The application should be able to scale up or down based on the number of users accessing it at any given time. This means that the application should be able to handle a sudden surge in traffic without crashing or slowing down. Additionally, the application should be able to add more resources such as servers or storage as needed to accommodate the increased traffic.

Additional information: Durability is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to maintain its functionality and performance over time, even in the face of adverse conditions such as hardware failures, power outages, or other disruptions. This requirement is important for systems that are critical to the operation of an organization or that handle sensitive or valuable data.

According to the TOGAF specification, durability is one of the key quality attributes that must be considered when designing and implementing an enterprise architecture. This requirement is closely related to other non-functional requirements such as reliability, availability, and maintainability, which together form the basis of a system's overall performance and effectiveness.

To ensure that a system meets the durability requirement, architects and designers must consider a range of factors, including the robustness of hardware components, the resilience of software applications, and the effectiveness of backup and recovery procedures. They must also consider the impact of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and power fluctuations, and design systems that can withstand these conditions without compromising performance or functionality.

In addition to these technical considerations, architects and designers must also consider the organizational and operational factors that can affect durability. This includes factors such as training and support for system users, maintenance and repair procedures, and disaster recovery planning.

Overall, the durability requirement is a critical aspect of enterprise architecture design, and must be carefully considered and addressed in order to ensure the long-term success and effectiveness of a system.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Durability' could be for a database system to maintain data integrity and availability even in the event of hardware failures or power outages. This means that the system should be able to recover quickly and efficiently from any disruptions or failures without losing any data or causing any downtime for users. The durability requirement ensures that the system can handle unexpected events and maintain its functionality over time.

      <documentation>Definition: Consistency is an important non-functional requirement in IT systems that refers to the uniformity and coherence of data and processes across different components of the system. It ensures that the system behaves predictably and reliably, and that users can trust the accuracy and completeness of the information they receive. Consistency can be achieved through the use of standardized formats, protocols, and interfaces, as well as through rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures. It is particularly important in distributed systems, where data and processes may be spread across multiple servers or networks.

Source: TOGAF

Source reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap03.html

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, guidelines, and documentation, the non-functional requirement of 'Consistency' refers to the need for the IT system to maintain a uniform and coherent approach to its operations, data, and interfaces. This consistency should be maintained across all components of the system, including hardware, software, and network infrastructure.

Consistency is essential for ensuring that the system operates smoothly and efficiently, without any unexpected or unpredictable behavior. It also helps to ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with the system, without encountering any confusing or conflicting information.

To achieve consistency, the IT system should adhere to established standards and best practices, such as those defined by industry bodies or regulatory agencies. It should also use a common set of data definitions and formats, and ensure that all interfaces and interactions are designed and implemented in a consistent manner.

In addition, the IT system should be designed and tested to ensure that it can maintain consistency even under varying conditions, such as changes in workload, network traffic, or hardware failures. This may involve implementing redundancy or failover mechanisms, or using load balancing techniques to distribute workload across multiple servers.

Overall, the non-functional requirement of 'Consistency' is critical for ensuring that the IT system operates reliably and predictably, and provides a consistent and seamless experience for users.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Consistency' could be ensuring that all user interfaces across a software application have a consistent look and feel, including font sizes, colors, and button placements. This can help to improve user experience and reduce confusion or frustration when navigating the application.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, Resiliency is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of an IT system to recover from failures or disruptions and continue to function as intended. This requirement is essential for ensuring that the system can withstand unexpected events such as hardware failures, power outages, or cyber-attacks.

To meet the Resiliency requirement, IT systems must be designed with redundancy and fault-tolerant mechanisms that enable them to continue operating even when one or more components fail. This may involve the use of backup systems, redundant hardware, or failover mechanisms that automatically switch to a backup system when the primary system fails.

In addition to technical measures, Resiliency also requires the implementation of robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans that outline procedures for responding to disruptions and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible. These plans should be regularly tested and updated to ensure that they remain effective in the face of changing threats and circumstances.

Overall, Resiliency is a critical non-functional requirement for IT systems that must be carefully considered and addressed throughout the entire system development lifecycle. By ensuring that systems are designed with Resiliency in mind, organizations can minimize the risk of downtime and data loss, and maintain the continuity of their operations even in the face of unexpected events.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Resiliency' could be that the system should be able to recover from hardware or software failures within a specified time frame, without losing any data or causing significant downtime. This could involve implementing redundancy measures such as backup servers, failover mechanisms, and data replication to ensure that the system can continue to operate even in the event of a failure. Additionally, the system should be able to handle high levels of traffic or usage without becoming overwhelmed or crashing, and should be able to scale up or down as needed to accommodate changing demands.

      <documentation>Definition: An API contract is a non-functional requirement that specifies the rules and guidelines for how an application programming interface (API) should behave. It defines the expected behavior of the API, including the input and output formats, error handling, security, and performance. The API contract ensures that the API is consistent and predictable, making it easier for developers to use and integrate with other systems. It also helps to ensure that the API is reliable, scalable, and maintainable over time.

Source: TOGAF

Source reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap03.html

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, an API contract is a non-functional requirement that defines the terms and conditions for using an application programming interface (API). It specifies the rules and guidelines that must be followed by both the API provider and the API consumer to ensure that the API functions as intended and meets the required quality attributes.

The API contract includes details such as the API's input and output parameters, error handling procedures, security requirements, performance expectations, and other technical specifications. It also outlines the expected behavior of the API under different scenarios and usage patterns.

The API contract is a critical component of the API design process, as it helps to ensure that the API is reliable, scalable, and maintainable. It also helps to minimize the risk of errors and inconsistencies in the API implementation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and other problems.

To create an effective API contract, it is important to involve all stakeholders, including the API provider, API consumer, and any other relevant parties. The contract should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, and should be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the API or its usage patterns.

Example: One example of an IT non-functional requirement for an API contract could be that the API must have a clearly defined and documented interface that specifies the expected inputs, outputs, and behavior of the API. This interface should be consistent and stable over time, so that clients can rely on it and build their own applications around it. Additionally, the API should be designed to be scalable and performant, so that it can handle large volumes of requests and respond quickly to user actions.

To achieve integrity, the system must have appropriate security measures in place, such as access controls, authentication, encryption, and auditing. It must also have mechanisms to detect and prevent data tampering, such as checksums, digital signatures, or version control.

Integrity is closely related to other non-functional requirements, such as availability, reliability, and performance. A system that lacks integrity may also suffer from data loss, downtime, or poor performance, which can have severe consequences for the users and the organization.

Overall, integrity is a critical non-functional requirement that ensures the trustworthiness and reliability of data and information within a system. It must be carefully considered and implemented to ensure the security and effectiveness of the system.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Integrity' is ensuring that data is not altered or modified during transmission or storage. This can be achieved through the use of encryption, checksums, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, data backups and disaster recovery plans can help ensure that data remains intact and accessible in the event of a system failure or other disruption.

Additional information: Modularity and reusability are non-functional requirements that are essential for the development of robust and scalable IT systems. According to the TOGAF specification, guidelines, and documentation, modularity refers to the ability of a system to be broken down into smaller, independent components or modules. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained separately, which makes it easier to modify or replace them without affecting the rest of the system.

Reusability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a system or its components to be used in different contexts or applications. This means that the system or its components should be designed in a way that they can be easily adapted or extended to meet the requirements of different users or applications.

To achieve modularity and reusability, the TOGAF framework recommends the use of standard interfaces and protocols that allow different components to communicate with each other. This can be achieved through the use of service-oriented architecture (SOA) or microservices, which provide a modular and flexible approach to system design.

In addition, the TOGAF framework recommends the use of design patterns and best practices that promote modularity and reusability. These include the use of abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance to create modular and reusable components that can be easily extended or modified.

Overall, modularity and reusability are critical non-functional requirements that should be considered throughout the entire system development lifecycle. By following the TOGAF framework and best practices, IT systems can be designed to be more flexible, scalable, and adaptable to changing business needs.

Example: One example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Modularity and reusability' could be the development of a software application that can be easily integrated with other systems and components. This means that the application should be designed in a modular way, with clear interfaces and well-defined APIs, so that it can be easily reused and adapted to different environments and use cases. Additionally, the application should be built using standard technologies and programming languages, so that it can be easily maintained and updated over time. This requirement is important for organizations that need to integrate multiple systems and applications, as it helps to reduce development time and costs, and improves overall system performance and reliability.

      <documentation>Definition: Elasticity is an IT non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to scale up or down in response to changes in demand. This means that the system should be able to handle increased traffic or workload without compromising its performance or stability. Elasticity is important for systems that experience unpredictable or fluctuating demand, as it allows them to maintain optimal performance and avoid downtime. It also helps organizations to optimize their resource utilization and reduce costs by scaling down when demand decreases.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, Elasticity is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to scale up or down its resources in response to changing demands. This requirement is closely related to the concept of scalability, which refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads without compromising its performance.

Elasticity is an important requirement for systems that are expected to handle varying levels of traffic or workload. For example, a web application that experiences a sudden surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign or a news event should be able to scale up its resources to handle the increased demand. Similarly, a system that experiences a decrease in traffic during off-peak hours should be able to scale down its resources to save costs.

To achieve elasticity, a system should be designed with the following characteristics:

1. Modularity: The system should be composed of independent modules that can be scaled up or down independently.

2. Automation: The scaling process should be automated to minimize human intervention and reduce the risk of errors.

3. Monitoring: The system should be monitored continuously to detect changes in demand and trigger the scaling process.

4. Resilience: The system should be able to handle failures and recover quickly from them.

5. Flexibility: The system should be able to adapt to different types of workloads and resource requirements.

Overall, elasticity is an important non-functional requirement that can help ensure that a system is able to handle changing demands and provide a consistent level of performance.

Example: An example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Elasticity' could be the ability of a cloud-based application to automatically scale up or down its computing resources based on the current demand. This means that the application should be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic without crashing or slowing down, while also being able to reduce its resource usage during periods of low activity to save costs.

Additional information: Authorization is a non-functional requirement that is related to the security aspect of an IT system. It refers to the process of granting or denying access to resources or functionalities based on the identity and privileges of the user or entity requesting access. 

According to the TOGAF specification, Authorization is a key aspect of security architecture and should be designed to ensure that only authorized users or entities can access the system or its resources. The authorization process should be based on a well-defined set of policies and rules that are consistent with the organization's security policies and regulatory requirements.

The TOGAF guidelines recommend that the authorization process should be implemented using a combination of authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the user or entity requesting access, while authorization is the process of determining whether the user or entity has the necessary privileges to access the requested resource. Access control is the process of enforcing the authorization decisions by controlling the actual access to the resource.

To ensure that the authorization process is effective, the TOGAF documentation recommends that the security architecture should include mechanisms for monitoring and auditing the authorization process. This will help to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts and ensure that the system is compliant with the organization's security policies and regulatory requirements.

In summary, Authorization is a non-functional requirement that is critical for ensuring the security of an IT system. It should be designed based on a well-defined set of policies and rules, and implemented using a combination of authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms. The authorization process should be monitored and audited to ensure that it is effective and compliant with the organization's security policies and regulatory requirements.

Example: One example of an IT non-functional requirement for Authorization could be that only users with specific roles or permissions are able to access certain features or data within a software application. This could include restrictions on who can create, edit, or delete certain types of content, or who can view sensitive information such as financial data or personal information. The authorization system should also be secure and reliable, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot gain access to restricted areas or data.

By ensuring that a system can recover quickly and efficiently from failures, organizations can minimize downtime, reduce costs, and ensure that critical business operations can continue uninterrupted.

Example: In a banking application, the recoverability non-functional requirement would ensure that in case of a system failure or crash, the system can recover all the data and transactions that were in progress before the failure occurred. This would ensure that no data is lost and the system can resume normal operations without any major disruptions.

      <documentation>Definition: Latency is a non-functional requirement that refers to the time delay between the initiation of a request and the response received. It is a critical factor in determining the overall performance of a system, particularly in real-time applications such as online gaming, video conferencing, and financial trading. Low latency is desirable as it ensures that the system responds quickly to user requests, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. High latency, on the other hand, can lead to frustration and decreased productivity, making it essential to ensure that latency is kept to a minimum in any IT system.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, Latency is a non-functional requirement that refers to the time delay between the initiation of a request and the response received. It is a measure of the time taken for data to travel from one point to another, and is typically measured in milliseconds (ms).

Latency is an important consideration for IT systems that require real-time or near-real-time responses, such as financial trading systems, online gaming platforms, and video conferencing applications. High latency can result in delays, lag, and poor user experience, which can negatively impact the performance and usability of the system.

To ensure that latency requirements are met, IT architects must consider a range of factors, including network bandwidth, server processing power, and data storage capacity. They must also design systems that are optimized for low latency, using techniques such as caching, load balancing, and content delivery networks (CDNs).

In addition, IT architects must work closely with stakeholders to define latency requirements and establish appropriate performance metrics. This may involve conducting performance testing and benchmarking to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the system meets the required latency targets.

Overall, latency is a critical non-functional requirement that must be carefully considered and managed throughout the IT system development lifecycle to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

Example: An example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Latency' could be for a video conferencing application to have a maximum latency of 100 milliseconds to ensure smooth and real-time communication between participants.

Interoperability Saliency: The Public Administration ABB is salient for behavioural and organizational interoperability because it represents the specific authority in charge of supporting the definition of procedures and business rules to publish digital business capabilities. It also allows the security assurance and control configuration associated with this authority or public entity, the discovery of data types that it can provide, as well as other aspects necessary to assure, monitor and control the exchange of data between this public entity and the digital public services providing to or consuming data from this stakeholder.

Additional information: The provision of digital public services are Public Administration's means of implementing e-Government. Certain countries make the difference between e-Government (policy implementation management) and e-Administration (administrative procedure management using electronic means). For these countries, the case of the SDG would fall under the e-Administration umbrella.

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Public Service Operation Principle Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of principles and guidelines that are essential for the operation of digital public services. These principles include convergence control on public policy goals attainment, data accessibility, data findability, data interoperability, data reusability, preservation of information, security by design, and trust.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Digital Public Service Operation Principle Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of principles that guide the operation of digital public services. 'Convergence control on public policy goals attainment' refers to the alignment of digital services with public policy goals. 'Data Accessibility' and 'Data Findability' pertain to the ease of access and discovery of data respectively. 'Data Interoperability' and 'Data Reusability' concern the ability of systems to work together and the potential for data to be reused. 'Preservation of information' is about maintaining and protecting data, while 'Security by Design' is a principle that emphasizes the importance of incorporating security measures from the onset of system design. Lastly, 'Trust' refers to the confidence and reliability in digital public services.

Example: An example of the application of these principles can be seen in a digital public service like an online tax filing system. The system should be designed with 'Security by Design', ensuring that user data is protected. The data collected should be 'Accessible' and 'Findable' for users, and 'Interoperable' to allow for seamless interaction with other systems. The system should also allow for 'Data Reusability', enabling data to be used for multiple purposes. The 'Preservation of Information' is crucial to maintain historical tax records. The system should also align with the 'Convergence control on public policy goals attainment' by facilitating the efficient collection of taxes. Lastly, the system should foster 'Trust' among users by being reliable and secure.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: Despite the vital role architecture principles play, there are situations where certain principles may not be employed within a specific solution architecture. The Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue ABB serves as a repository for documenting such cases. Including explanatory notes alongside each omitted principle is crucial. These notes should provide a clear rationale for the exclusion, explaining the context, constraints, or trade-offs that led to the decision. The catalogue facilitates knowledge sharing among architects by capturing the context and rationale behind each omitted principle. It also helps ensure that architectural decisions align with organizational governance frameworks and compliance requirements. Furthermore, it enables architects to proactively address potential risks and develop mitigation strategies. The documentation of omitted principles promotes a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging architects to revisit decisions, reassess trade-offs, and learn from past experiences.

Example: For instance, an architecture principle related to the use of open standards may not be implemented in a solution architecture due to vendor lock-in or specific business requirements. This omission would be documented in the Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue ABB, along with an explanation of the reasons for the deviation. This documentation would then serve as a reference for future architects, helping them understand the trade-offs made and informing their decision-making process.

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Public Service Design Principle Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of principles and guidelines aimed at shaping the design and implementation of digital public services. These principles encompass various aspects including administrative simplification, carbon-dioxide e-footprint impact awareness, code of ethics compliance, data portability, EU legislation compliance, integrated user experience, multilingualism, privacy, proactiveness, service orientation, technology neutrality, and user-centricity among others.

Additional information: The Digital Public Service Design Principle Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of principles that guide the design and delivery of digital public services. These principles are aimed at ensuring that digital services are user-centric, efficient, ethical, and compliant with relevant legislation. They cover a broad spectrum of considerations from administrative simplification which aims to reduce bureaucratic processes and make public services more accessible, to carbon-dioxide e-footprint impact awareness which encourages the design of digital services that are environmentally friendly. Other principles like data portability and privacy ensure that users' data is handled responsibly and securely. The catalogue also includes principles like multilingualism and integrated user experience which aim to make digital services more inclusive and user-friendly.

Example: An example of application of these principles can be seen in the design of a digital public service like an online tax filing system. The system would need to be designed with user-centricity in mind, ensuring it is easy to use for all citizens. It would also need to comply with EU legislation and a code of ethics, ensuring data is handled securely and responsibly. The system should also be designed with an awareness of its carbon-dioxide e-footprint, aiming to minimise its environmental impact. Furthermore, the principle of administrative simplification would be applied to make the tax filing process as straightforward and efficient as possible.

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling sense-making nature of these resources influencing the enactment of common understanding from the existing organisational information. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared knowledge base (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared knowledge base (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective). The level of semantic interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared knowledge base enables: i) structural interoperability with semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. data set catalogue); ii) behavioural interoperability with semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Metadata mappings); and iii) governance interoperability with semantic resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge cross legal jurisdictions (i.e. Sematic Interoperability Agreements).

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Solution Scalability Architecture Decision Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that are designed to ensure that a system can effectively scale to handle increased workload or user demands. This includes decisions related to horizontal scaling, database sharding, elastic cloud infrastructure, containerization and orchestration, vertical scaling, load balancing strategy, and scalability for growth.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Digital Solution Scalability Architecture Decision Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of ADRs that address various aspects of system scalability. 'Horizontal Scaling' refers to the ability to increase capacity by connecting multiple hardware or software entities to work as a single logical unit. 'Database Sharding' is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. 'Elastic Cloud Infrastructure' refers to the provision of IT infrastructure through the internet on an on-demand, pay-per-use basis. 'Containerization and Orchestration' involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. 'Vertical Scaling' involves adding more resources such as computing power or memory to a server, or replacing one server with a more powerful one. 'Load Balancing Strategy' involves distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed with traffic. 'Scalability for Growth' involves designing the system in such a way that it can handle increased workload or user demands in the future.

Example: For instance, a company might decide to adopt a horizontal scaling strategy to handle increased user demands during peak times. This might involve adding more servers to their system to distribute the load more evenly. Similarly, a company with a large, complex database might decide to implement database sharding to improve performance and make the database more manageable. On the other hand, a company expecting rapid growth might decide to adopt an elastic cloud infrastructure to easily scale up or down based on demand.

      <documentation>Definition: Scalability Requirements Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of non-functional IT requirements that are critical for ensuring the scalability, performance, and efficiency of a system or application. It includes elements such as Traffic Pattern, Elasticity, and Latency, each of which plays a key role in determining how well a system can handle user traffic and respond to changes in demand.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Scalability Requirements Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of non-functional requirements that are essential for the design and operation of scalable IT systems. The 'Traffic Pattern' element refers to the expected volume and frequency of user traffic, which helps in planning the necessary infrastructure and resources. 'Elasticity' refers to the system's ability to scale up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. 'Latency', on the other hand, refers to the time delay between a request and response, which is a crucial factor in the overall user experience. By considering these elements, IT professionals can design systems that are robust, scalable, and efficient, meeting the needs of users while optimizing resource utilization.

Example: For instance, a video streaming service needs to consider all these elements in their system design. The 'Traffic Pattern' would help them prepare for peak viewing times and ensure the system can handle the load. 'Elasticity' would allow the service to scale up during popular live events and scale down during off-peak hours, optimizing resource use. Lastly, 'Latency' is critical for providing a smooth viewing experience, as high latency could lead to buffering and lagging issues.

      <documentation>Definition: Durability Requirements Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a set of non-functional IT requirements that ensure the long-term reliability, stability, and accessibility of a system. These requirements include replication, fault tolerance, and archivability, each of which plays a crucial role in maintaining the system's performance, security, and data integrity over time.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Durability Requirements Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of non-functional requirements that are essential for the long-term operation of a system. 'Replication' refers to the system's ability to duplicate data or processes across multiple servers or locations, ensuring high availability and reliability. 'Fault tolerance' is the system's ability to continue functioning despite hardware or software failures, involving redundancy, backup systems, and failover mechanisms. 'Archivability' refers to the system's ability to store and retrieve data over a long period of time, ensuring that the data remains accurate, complete, and secure. Each of these elements is critical for systems that handle sensitive or critical data, such as those used in healthcare, finance, and transportation.

Example: An example of the application of the Durability Requirements Catalogue ABB could be a healthcare system. The system would need to replicate patient data across multiple servers to ensure it is always available when needed. It would also need to be fault-tolerant, so that in the event of a hardware or software failure, the system could continue to function without disruption. Lastly, the system would need to be archivable, storing patient data securely and in a retrievable format for many years, in compliance with regulatory requirements.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The recent economic and financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the EU's economic governance. The EU responded by taking a wide range of measures to strengthen its governance and to facilitate a return to sustainable economic growth, job creation, financial stability and sound public finances.(https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/eu-economic-governance-explained.pdf)

Interoperability Saliency: The Shared Organisational Content ABB is a key interoperability enabler (*) for the governance, behavioural and structural enablers. This ABB is salient for legal interoperability because it defines the public policy goals that enable enabling i) sharing/provisioning/reusing/consumption of understandings and agreements on digital public services,  ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services, and iii) collaboration between digital public services

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling communication and harmonization nature of these resources influencing collaboration cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared governance framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the organisational perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared governance framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the organizational perspective). The level of organizational interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared governance framework enables: i) structural interoperability with organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogues); ii) behavioural interoperability with organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. user experience patterns and service delivery mode); and iii) governance interoperability with governance resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Organisational Interoperability Agreements).

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Chronos is a replacement for cron. It is a distributed and fault-tolerant scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos that can be used for job orchestration. It supports custom Mesos executors as well as the default command executor. Thus by default, Chronos executes sh (on most systems bash) scripts. https://sourceforge.net/projects/chronos.mirror/

Interoperability Saliency: The Schedule Management Enablers Grouping ABB is salient for technical interoperability because it comprises the different services and tools that allow to organise and manage events within a platform for the delivery of a digital public service. It enables interoperability by allowing the management of events through a single point of access (for users and administrations) and the reuse of such information to an overall relationship between public administration and stakeholders.

      <documentation>Definition: Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) alignment guidelines ABB is a Grouping that covers the process of establishing a harmonious relationship between the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) model and any given Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). The aim is to make the EIRA model fully compliant with the chosen EAF, promoting uniformity across the architectural ecosystem.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The EAF alignment guidelines serve as an integral part of the process, aiming to establish a harmonious relationship between the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) model and any given Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). The ultimate goal is to make the EIRA model fully compliant with the chosen EAF, promoting uniformity across the architectural ecosystem. The elements contained within these guidelines include Interoperable European Solution, Achieve Interoperability, Creation of Interoperable European Solutions, European Interoperability Reference Architecture, Coordination Capacity, Regulatory Capacity, Delivery Capacity, Analytical Capacity, EIRA Ontology, Public Administration, Architecture Principle, Constraints, Assumptions and Decisions, Shared Legal Content, Shared Organisational Content, Digital Solution Requirement, Iternational Data Spaces Reference Architecture Model (IDS-RAM), Data Spaces Business Alliance, Eclipse Dataspace Components, JRC Data Spaces Knowledge Base, FIWARE for Data Spaces, Gaia-X Data Spaces Community.

Example: An example of the application of the EAF alignment guidelines could be the process of aligning a national public administration's enterprise architecture with the EIRA model. This would involve assessing the current architecture, identifying gaps and areas of non-compliance, and implementing changes to achieve alignment. The guidelines would provide a roadmap for this process, outlining the necessary steps and considerations.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The DSUADC is a comprehensive catalogue that documents crucial decisions made about the usability aspects of a digital solution's architecture. Each element in the catalogue represents a specific area of focus. 'Adequacy Recognition' refers to decisions about how well the solution meets user needs and expectations. 'Learning' covers decisions about how users learn to use the solution. 'Operability' involves decisions about the ease of operating the solution. 'User Interface' refers to decisions about the design and functionality of the user interface. 'Accessibility' covers decisions about making the solution accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

Example: For instance, an ADR under 'Adequacy Recognition' might document the decision to use a particular user feedback system to ensure the solution meets user needs. An ADR under 'Learning' might cover the decision to include interactive tutorials to help new users learn how to use the solution. An ADR under 'Operability' might document the decision to use a specific technology to ensure smooth operation of the solution. An ADR under 'User Interface' could cover the decision to use a specific design pattern for the user interface. Lastly, an ADR under 'Accessibility' might document the decision to follow specific accessibility standards to make the solution usable by people with disabilities.

Additional information: The catalogue includes elements such as 'Technology Stack Selection', 'API Design', 'Event-Driven Architecture', 'Database Schema Design', 'Asynchronous Processing', 'Provide a Service Catalog', 'Managing Self-Description Schemas in the Federated Catalogue', 'Monolithic Architecture', 'Microservice Architecture', 'Serveless Architecture', 'Cloud-Native Architecture', 'Big-Data Architecture', and 'Service-Oriented Architecture'. Each of these elements represents a specific architectural decision that needs to be made during the development of a software system. These decisions are critical as they determine the overall structure and functionality of the system, as well as its ability to meet the needs of its users and to adapt to changes in technology and business requirements.

Example: For instance, the 'Technology Stack Selection' element involves deciding on the specific technologies to be used in the system, such as the programming languages, databases, server technologies, and other tools. The 'API Design' element involves deciding on the structure and functionality of the APIs that the system will provide, which can affect its interoperability with other systems. The 'Event-Driven Architecture' element involves deciding on the use of events to drive the system's behavior, which can affect its responsiveness and scalability.

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Solution High Availability and Resilience Architecture Decision Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of decisions related to optimizing the performance of a system. These decisions may include choices regarding caching strategies, load balancing techniques, database optimizations, or any other performance-related considerations. The catalogue includes elements such as Caching Strategy, Content Delivery Network, Performance Testing and Tuning, Network Optimization, Application of Service Monitoring Tools, Application of Service Monitoring Tools Configuration, and Disaster Recovery Plan.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Digital Solution High Availability and Resilience Architecture Decision Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of elements that capture decisions related to optimizing the performance of a system. Each element in the catalogue represents a specific decision area, with a focus on strategies and techniques that can enhance system performance, ensure high availability, and build resilience. The elements are described in the form of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which provide a detailed account of the decision-making process, the options considered, the decision taken, and the reasons behind the decision.

Example: For instance, the 'Caching Strategy' element in the catalogue might detail the decision to use a distributed caching system to improve the performance of a data-intensive application. The 'Content Delivery Network' element might describe the decision to use a global CDN to ensure fast and reliable content delivery to users worldwide. The 'Performance Testing and Tuning' element might outline the decision to implement a rigorous performance testing regime and a continuous tuning process to maintain optimal system performance. Similarly, the 'Network Optimization', 'Application of Service Monitoring Tools', 'Application of Service Monitoring Tools Configuration', and 'Disaster Recovery Plan' elements would detail decisions in their respective areas.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The past years have seen an extraordinary proliferation of sharing economy platforms, and the largest platforms have fast become global enterprises with market capitalisations that exceed competitors with “traditional” business concepts. These developments call into question a number of regulatory matters and pose new questions for national and European-level regulators. (https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2017/number/1/article/regulating-the-european-sharing-economy-state-of-play-and-challenges.html).

Interoperability Saliency: The Shared Legal Content ABB is a key interoperability enabler (*) for governance, behavioural and structural interoperability because it supports to achieve of it with public policy goals convergence value by enabling i) sharing/provisioning/reusing/consumption of legislation on digital public services, ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services, and iii) collaboration between digital public services. 

Additional information: The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared legal framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the legal perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared legal framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the legal perspective). The level of legal interoperability will constrain digital public services cross-legal jurisdictions.

Additional information: The Digital Solution Non-Functional Requirements Catalogue ABB includes various elements such as Extensibility, Observability, Security, Agility, Resiliency, Consistency, Scalability, Availability, Usability, and Durability. Each of these elements has a specific role and importance in the overall system design and operation. For instance, Extensibility refers to the system's ability to accommodate future changes or additions seamlessly, while Observability refers to the system's ability to monitor and analyze its behavior in real-time. Similarly, Security refers to the system's ability to protect itself against unauthorized access and data breaches, while Agility refers to the system's ability to adapt quickly to changing business needs or market conditions. The catalogue also includes various sub-elements under each main element, providing a comprehensive list of non-functional requirements for digital solutions.

Example: An example of applying the Digital Solution Non-Functional Requirements Catalogue ABB could be during the design and development of a new digital banking application. The developers would need to consider various non-functional requirements such as Security (to protect users' financial information), Availability (to ensure the app is always accessible), Usability (to ensure the app is user-friendly), Scalability (to handle increasing number of users), and Extensibility (to easily add new features in the future). Additionally, they would also need to consider sub-elements such as Confidentiality and Integrity under Security, Accessibility and Learnability under Usability, and Disaster Recovery and Recoverability under Resiliency.

Functional requirements: What are the specific functions and features that the solution must provide?&#xD;
Non-functional requirements: What are the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and accessibility?&#xD;
Cost-benefit analysis: What are the costs and benefits of the solution? Is it a cost-effective solution?&#xD;
Interoperability: How will the solution interoperate with other systems and services? Is it compliant with the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA)?&#xD;
The analysis of a target digital public solution can be conducted using a variety of methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
User research: This involves gathering data about the needs, expectations, and capabilities of the target audience.&#xD;
Technical assessment: This involves evaluating the technical feasibility of the solution, including its performance, security, and accessibility.&#xD;
Cost-benefit analysis: This involves estimating the costs and benefits of the solution.&#xD;
Interoperability testing: This involves testing the solution to ensure that it is compliant with the EIRA.&#xD;
The results of the analysis of a target digital public solution should be documented and used to inform the development and implementation of the solution. The analysis should also be reviewed and updated as the solution evolves and new requirements emerge.</documentation>

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Solution Architecture Decision Catalogue ABB is a Grouping that covers a comprehensive collection of architecture decisions related to digital solutions. It includes decisions about technical architecture, business architecture, security, privacy and compliance, high availability and resilience, scalability, portability, maintainability, quality, and usability. Each decision is documented in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that describes the context, decision, and consequences.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The catalogue is divided into several categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of digital solution architecture. For example, the 'Digital Solution Technical Architecture Decision Catalogue' includes decisions about technology stack selection, API design, event-driven architecture, database schema design, and more. Similarly, the 'Digital Solution Business Architecture Decision Catalogue' includes decisions about cross-border identification business, dynamic location of data provider, data notification deployment, and others. Each decision is documented in an ADR, providing a record of why and how decisions were made, aiding in future understanding and decision-making.

Example: An example of an element in the catalogue is 'Technology Stack Selection'. This is an ADR that documents the decision-making process for selecting the technology stack for a digital solution. It would include the context (why the decision was needed), the decision (what was decided), and the consequences (the impact of the decision).

The 'Recoverability' element, on the other hand, refers to the system's ability to recover from failures or errors and return to its normal functioning. This involves implementing backup and recovery mechanisms, such as data replication, redundancy, and failover.

Example: An example of the application of the Resiliency Requirements Catalogue ABB could be in the development of a cloud-based data storage system. The 'Disaster Recovery' element would involve creating a detailed plan for how the system would recover from a catastrophic event, such as a major power outage or a cyber-attack. This could include strategies such as regular data backups, the use of redundant systems, and the implementation of failover mechanisms. The 'Recoverability' element would involve ensuring that the system has the ability to recover data, configurations, and settings after a system crash or other disruptions. This could involve the use of data replication, redundancy, and failover mechanisms.

          <documentation>The EIRA© API viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks required when modelling an API Interface. &#xD;
The ABBs included in the API viewpoint represent all the required Building Block necessary to design an API Interface accessible thoruh a web interface. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Client request for service] is made trough [Internet] and it triggers the [Authentication Service] which serves the [Request Validation Service]that triggers the [HTTP(s) Load Balancer] whichin turn triggers all the [Endpoints] related. Each [Endpoint] serves the [Application Service] which triggers the [App Component] that, in turn, triggers the [Data Access Service]. The [Data Access Service] provides access to the [Data Space] which is composed by the [SQL Data Space], [Read - Replica], [NoSQL Data Space] and [Virtual Data Space]. In the moment in which the [Endpoint] is triggered data flows to the [API Response] which is composed by [Data] and [Represenation] accessed by a [Request Validation Service]. The [API Response] triggers the response that is provided to the user who requetd the data in the first instance.</documentation>

            <content>The European Interoperability Framework underlying principles view models the motivation of the EIRA© in terms of goals to be achieved and the principles to be followed in order to achieve interoperability in public services. &#xD;
The interoperability principles are fundamental behavioural aspects to drive interoperable public services.  They describe the context in which European public services are designed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The twelve underlying principles of the EIF are grouped into four categories:&#xD;
1.	Principle setting the context for EU actions on interoperability (Subsidiarity and proportionality);&#xD;
2.	Core interoperability principles (Openness, Transparency, Reusability, Technological neutrality and data portability);&#xD;
3.	Principles related to generic user needs and expectations (User-centricity, Inclusion and accessibility, Security and privacy, Multilingualism);&#xD;
4.	Foundation principles for cooperation among public administrations (Administrative simplification, Preservation of information, Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency).</content>

            <content>The &quot;Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue&quot;:&#xD;
Despite the vital role architecture principles play, there are situations where certain principles may not be employed within a specific solution architecture. It is important to maintain transparency and ensure that these omissions are duly noted and communicated. The &quot;Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue&quot; serves as a repository for documenting such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
Including explanatory notes alongside each omitted principle is crucial. These notes should provide a clear rationale for the exclusion, explaining the context, constraints, or trade-offs that led to the decision. By doing so, the documentation acts as a reference for future architects, fostering a deeper understanding of the architectural choices made and promoting informed decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Benefits of Documenting Omitted Principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
Knowledge Sharing: The catalogue facilitates knowledge sharing among architects by capturing the context and rationale behind each omitted principle. This ensures that valuable insights are not lost, enabling future architects to make informed decisions based on prior experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Governance and Compliance: The documentation of omitted principles helps ensure that architectural decisions align with organizational governance frameworks and compliance requirements. It provides visibility into the reasons behind deviations from standard architectural practices, allowing stakeholders to assess risks and make informed judgments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Risk Management: Identifying and acknowledging the absence of certain architecture principles helps uncover potential risks and trade-offs associated with the solution architecture. It enables architects to proactively address these risks and develop mitigation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continuous Improvement: The documentation of omitted principles promotes a culture of continuous improvement. It encourages architects to revisit decisions, reassess trade-offs, and learn from past experiences, ultimately refining their approach to solution architecture.</content>

          <documentation>The European Interoperability Framework underlying principles view models the motivation of the EIRA© in terms of goals to be achieved and the principles to be followed in order to achieve interoperability in public services. &#xD;
The interoperability principles are fundamental behavioural aspects to drive interoperable public services.  They describe the context in which European public services are designed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The twelve underlying principles of the EIF are grouped into four categories:&#xD;
1.	Principle setting the context for EU actions on interoperability (Subsidiarity and proportionality);&#xD;
2.	Core interoperability principles (Openness, Transparency, Reusability, Technological neutrality and data portability);&#xD;
3.	Principles related to generic user needs and expectations (User-centricity, Inclusion and accessibility, Security and privacy, Multilingualism);&#xD;
4.	Foundation principles for cooperation among public administrations (Administrative simplification, Preservation of information, Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency).&#xD;

Narrative: The twelve interoperability principles of the New EIF ([Subsidiarity and proportionality], [Openness], [Transparency], [Transparency], [Technological neutrality and data portability], [User-centricity], [Inclusion and accessibility], [Security and privacy], [Multilingualism], [Administrative simplification], [Preservation of information] and [Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency]) together fulfil the goals of achieving interoperability: [Achieve Legal Interoperability], [Achieve Organisational Interoperability], [Achieve Semantic Interoperability] and [Achieve Technical Interoperability].

The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Security and Privacy viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks related to both security and privacy in the domain of interoperability. Citizens and businesses must be confident that when they interact with public authorities they are doing so in a secure and trustworthy environment and in full compliance with relevant regulations, e.g. the Regulation and Directive on data protection, and the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services. Public administrations must guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy are primary concerns in the provision of public services. When public administrations and other entities exchange official information, the information should be transferred, depending on security requirements, via a secure, harmonised, managed and controlled network. Transfer mechanisms should facilitate information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens. Appropriate mechanisms should allow secure exchange of electronically verified messages, records, forms and other kinds of information between the different systems; should handle specific security requirements and electronic identification and trust services such as electronic signatures/seals creation and verification; and should monitor traffic to detect intrusions, changes of data and other type of attacks.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different view highlighting the Security and Privacy aspects of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the organisational view shows the [Security Framework], associated with the [Security Governance] which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view shows the [Security Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution], which considers [Human Interface] and [Machine to Machine Interface] is supported by a [Shared platform] which uses [Trust Enablers], [Application Security Enablers], [Identification and Access Enablers] and [Data Exchange Enablers]. [Trust Enablers] such as [Integrity Verification Service], [e-Signature Creation Service], [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-Signature Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Timestamp Verification and Validation Service], [e-Signature Preservation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service] and [Registered Electronic Delivery Service], are all realised by a [Trust Service Provisioning Component]. [Identification and Access Enablers] is composed of [Authentication Service], [Request Validation Service] and [Registration Service] which are realised by [Identification Component] and that provides access to the [Directory], accessed also by the [Access Management Service], realised by the [Access Management Component]. [Application Security Enablers] is realised of [Firewall Service], composed of [Firewall Component] and [Audit Service], which is realised by an [Audit Component]. [Data Exchange Enablers] composed of Data Exchange Service] realised by the [Data Exchange Component].&#xD;
&#xD;
5. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Infrastructure shows an [Outsourcing Facility] and [On - Premise Facility] composed of [Back End Firewall] and [Extranet Firewall]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the EIF Underlying Principles view show that [Interoperability Specifications] realises [EIF Principles], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks&#xD;

        <documentation>The Interoperability Privacy viewpoint highlights the EIRA building blocks that are relevant when implementing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or assessing an existing architecture against the GDPR principles. Public administrations must indeed guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are that are relevant with respect to GDPR:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show that privacy requirements are coming from a [Public Policy] realised by a [Binding instrument].&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that the [Privacy Framework] applies to the [Digital Public Service] which is assigned by the [Data Owner] and provided by the [Digital Public Service Provider]. The [Digital Public Service] serves the [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer], assigned to an [Individual] that is associated to the [Information] accessible though the [Organisation] which is a specialissed by [Public Administration] and [Business].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view show that [Data] aggregates [Data Set], [Ontology] and [Data Mapping] and that it is subject to the [Data Policy].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the Technical View shows many service involving data impacted by the privacy regulation, such as&#xD;
[Data Extraction,Transformation and Loading Service], [Data Quality Service], [e-Archiving Service], [Data Publication Service], [Data Exchange Service] and [Data Management Service]; all the services reported are realised by their specific Application Component. Additionally, a [Privacy Service], realised by a [Privacy Component] implementing GDPR principle can be used to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the EIF Underlying Principles view show the [EIF Principle], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks.</documentation>

        <documentation>The EIRA© Highlevel viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks of each view.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ABBs included in the high-level viewpoint represent the points that link the EIRA©’s views enabling traceability between their different Architecture Building Blocks. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;

The EIRA© with its views provides a set of Architecture Building Blocks, important to facilitate interoperability. Each view, one for each interoperability level, is represented with the Focal Architecture Building Blocks needed to deliver an interoperable solution. These focal Architecture Building Blocks are indicated with an accented colour.&#xD;
In the high-level are represented the ABBs that link the EIRA©’s views enabling navigation between the different views. As such they should be considered as critical components of any interoperable public service. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlighting the focal building blocks of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy] is realised by [Legal Act] and [Digital Public Service]; these two ABB, referred to the legal view, are aggregated within the [Shared Legal framework]. [Shared legal Framework] influences [Organisational Functional Content], [Semantic Functional Content], [Technical Application Functional Content].&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organizational view show a [Shared Governance Framework] that aggregates the [Organizational Functional Content] which considers a [Digital Public Service] which can be an aggregation of other [Digital Public Service]. The [Digital Public Service] realises a [Digital Business Capability]. A [Digital Business Capability] describes key functions supporting the [Digital Public Service]. A [Digital Public Service] accesses [Information], which can be an aggregation of other [Information]. At the same time a [Digital Public Service] is assigned by a [Digital Public Service Delivery] which is connected through a serving relation with the [Digital Public Service Delivery Model].&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view shows the [Shared Knowledge Base] and that the [Semantic Functional Content] is composed of a [Representation], stored as [Data] and the [Ontology]. &#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution Service] is composed of a [Digital Solution Service] realized by a [Digital Solution Component] and lets consumers access it via [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface], which are part of a [Application Presentation and Access Enablers]. A [Digital Solution] exposes one or more [Digital Solution Service] via its [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface]. The [Digital Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] which uses a [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - infrastructure considers the [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure].</documentation>

        <documentation>The IT Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) catalogue of a digital solution refers to a collection of documents that capture and document important architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of the solution.&#xD;
These records serve as a valuable reference for the project team, stakeholders, and future developers, providing insights into the rationale behind key design choices and the impact of those decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ADR catalogue typically includes the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
	+ Title/Identifier: Each ADR is assigned a unique title or identifier to enable easy identification and retrieval.&#xD;
	+ Context: This section provides a brief overview of the background and context that led to the architectural decision. It may include factors such as business requirements, technical constraints, or market considerations.&#xD;
	+ Decision: This section outlines the specific decision made, describing the chosen solution or approach in detail. It should clearly articulate the problem being addressed and the solution chosen.&#xD;
	+ Alternatives Considered: It is essential to document alternative solutions or approaches that were evaluated before settling on the chosen decision. This helps to understand the reasoning behind the selected option.&#xD;
	+ Rationale: The rationale section explains the reasoning behind the decision. It may include factors such as performance, scalability, security, cost, maintainability, compatibility, or other relevant considerations.&#xD;
	+ Implications: This section discusses the potential impact of the decision on the system, including any anticipated benefits, drawbacks, risks, or dependencies introduced by the chosen approach.&#xD;
	+ Related ADRs: If the decision has dependencies or relationships with other ADRs, those connections should be documented in this section. It helps in establishing the traceability and understanding the interconnectedness of decisions.&#xD;
	+ Status and Date: Each ADR should include the current status (e.g., proposed, accepted, rejected, superseded) and the date when the decision was made or recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
By maintaining a comprehensive ADR catalogue, organizations can foster transparency, facilitate collaboration, and ensure consistency in architectural decision-making across teams and projects.&#xD;
It serves as a knowledge repository and assists in understanding the evolution and reasoning behind the architecture of a digital solution.&#xD;

        <documentation>A non-functional requirements catalog for a digital solution includes a set of criteria and characteristics that describe how the solution should perform, rather than what it should do.&#xD;
These requirements focus on aspects such as performance, security, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes that determine the overall effectiveness and user experience of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here are some common categories of non-functional requirements that are often included in such a catalog:&#xD;
&#xD;
	+ Performance: Defines the speed, responsiveness, scalability, and efficiency of the solution under varying conditions, such as user load, data volume, or network latency.&#xD;
	+ Usability: Specifies the ease of use, intuitiveness, and accessibility of the solution, ensuring that it meets the needs and expectations of its intended users.&#xD;
	+ Reliability: Addresses the solution's ability to consistently perform its functions accurately and reliably over time, minimizing downtime and data loss.&#xD;
	+ Security: Covers the protection of data, information, and system resources against unauthorized access, tampering, or breaches. It may include aspects such as authentication, encryption, and compliance with relevant security standards.&#xD;
	+ Availability: Describes the solution's uptime requirements, including its ability to remain accessible and operational during scheduled maintenance or unexpected outages.&#xD;
	+ Scalability: Defines the solution's ability to handle increasing workload or user demand by efficiently utilizing resources and adapting to changing circumstances.&#xD;
	+ Maintainability: Refers to the ease of maintaining and modifying the solution, including aspects such as code maintainability, documentation, and the availability of development and debugging tools.&#xD;
	+ Interoperability: Specifies the solution's ability to integrate and communicate with other systems or components, often through the use of standardized protocols or interfaces.&#xD;
	+ Compliance: Ensures that the solution adheres to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, such as data protection regulations or accessibility guidelines.&#xD;
	+ Performance Efficiency: Focuses on optimizing resource usage, minimizing energy consumption, and maximizing the efficiency of the solution's operations.&#xD;
	+ Testability: Defines the ease with which the solution can be tested to ensure that it meets its functional and non-functional requirements, often through the use of automated testing tools and techniques.&#xD;
	+ Internationalization and Localization: Addresses the solution's ability to support multiple languages, regions, and cultural conventions to cater to a global user base.&#xD;
&#xD;
These are just some examples of non-functional requirements that may be included in a catalog for a digital solution. The specific requirements will depend on the nature of the solution, its intended use, and the stakeholders' needs.&#xD;

        <documentation>The Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) alignment guidelines viewpoint serves as an integral part of the process, aiming to establish a harmonious relationship between the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) model and any given Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). The ultimate goal is to make the EIRA model fully compliant with the chosen EAF, promoting uniformity across the architectural ecosystem.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this alignment diagram, each Architectural Building Block (ABB) carries a specific connection to the EIRA's Legal, Organisational, Semantic, and Technical (LOST) views that it belongs to. Each ABB forms a critical component of the architecture, representing distinct facets of the EIRA in the broader context of the selected EAF. This viewpoint connects different layers of the enterprise architecture, creating a comprehensive picture of the interoperability landscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
The intricate ties between each ABB and their corresponding LOST views can be thoroughly explored on the [Properties] sheet under the [Analysis] tab of Archi, a visual modelling and management tool for enterprise architecture. Here, users can investigate each ABB, understanding its role, its relationship with the LOST views, and its part in securing compliance with the EAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
The EAF alignment guidelines viewpoint allows organizations to align with industry standards, facilitates interoperability, and bridges the EIRA model with the selected EAF. It assists an organization in effectively detailing their enterprise architecture in line with their specific needs while maintaining alignment with larger industry frameworks.&#xD;
&#xD;
The viewpoint provides a structured layout, enhancing strategic decision-making, facilitating effective communication, and aiding the integration of different architectural elements. This organized alignment fortifies the architecture's robustness and provides a pathway for strategic expansion and evolution.</documentation>

        <documentation>The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint models the most salient key interoperability enablers(*). The viewpoint uses the ArchiMate© motivation extension to assess the structural interoperability readiness, the behavioral interoperability readiness and the governance interoperability readiness of solutions that are necessary to enable the efficient and effective delivery of public services across administrations. European public service provision often requires different public administrations to work together to meet end users’ needs and provide public services in an integrated way. When multiple organizations are involved there is a need for coordination and governance by the authorities with a mandate for planning, implementing and operating European public services. Services should be governed to ensure: collaboration, seamless execution, reuse of services and data, and development of new services and ‘building blocks'.&#xD;
 &#xD;
(*)DECISION (EU) 2015/2240 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2015 establishing a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2 programme) as a means for modernising the public sector.&#xD;
 &#xD;
The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint covers all EIF interoperability aspects: legal, organisational, semantic and technical. Ensuring interoperability when preparing legal instruments, organisation business processes, data/information/knowledge exchange, services and components that support European interoperable digital public services is a continuous task, as interoperability is regularly disrupted by changes to the environment, i.e. in legislation, the needs of businesses or citizens, the organisational structure of public administrations, the business processes, and by the emergence of new technologies.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA© that are key enablers for the interoperability of public services:&#xD;
&#xD;
1.	EIF [Interoperability Principles] are used to realise the overall goal of achieving interoperability. &#xD;
&#xD;
2.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieve Legal Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Legal Framework] of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
structural interoperability by legal resources supporting reusing and/or sharing legislation (i.e. [Legislation Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming legal texts cross public administrations and cross borders);&#xD;
behavioral interoperability by legal resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and&#xD;
governance interoperability by legislation supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] on legal terms assuring juridical certainty enabling agreed legal terms/conditions for sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders). &#xD;
&#xD;
3.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Organisational Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Governance Framework] of [re]usable organisational resources that enables: structural interoperability by organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. [Digital Public Service Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming public services cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioural interoperability by organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Digital Public Service Delivery Model], served by [Digital Public Service Delivery] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and governance interoperability by governance resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] on organisational terms/conditions enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Semantic Interoperability] is realized by a [Shared Knowledge Base] of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables: structural interoperability by semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data, information and knowledge (i.e. [Data Set Catalogue], [Ontologies Catalogue] and [Data Mapping Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming data, information and knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioral interoperability by semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Open Data], [Distributed Ledger] and [Virtual Data Set]; and governance interoperability by semantic resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] on interpretations enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).  &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Technical Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Application Content] and [Shared Infrastructure Content]. The [Shared Application Content] is a Grouping of ICT Resources components that enables structural interoperability by ICT resources supporting the reusing and sharing of data via [Software component Discovery and catalogue Service], [API Discovery and Catalogue Service] and [Service Discovery and Registry Service]; behavioural interoperability by ICT resources supporting communication via [Machine to Machine], [Human Interface], [Data Exchange Service], [UX Management Service] and [Digital Workplace Service], and governance interoperability by ICT resources supporting collaboration via [Technical Interoperability Agreements]. The [Shared Infrastructure Content] is a Grouping of ICT resources that enables structural interoperability by ICT resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data via [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure], behavioural interoperability by ICT resources supporting communication via [Technology Interface]. governance interoperability by ICT resources supports also the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Technical Interoperability Agreements] on technical terms/conditions enabling provisioning/consuming back-office services cross public administrations and cross borders), and governance interoperability by ICT resources supporting collaboration via [Technical Interoperability Agreements].</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Governance viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that refer to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels. As such, it does not include operational Architecture Building Blocks like interoperability agreements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Interoperability governance is the key to a holistic approach on interoperability, as it brings together all the instruments needed to apply it.&#xD;

&#xD;
Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are related to Interoperability Governance:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show the [Public Policy Cycle] and the [Legal Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Legal Agreement],&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that [Data Owner] signs [Organisational Agreement] which is a specialisation of the [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] and is composed by the [Framework Agreement] that is a specialisation of the [Specific Agreement] associated with [Means for Public Policy Objectives Convergence assurance]. The [Interoperability Strategy] implements the [Interoperability Framework], which influences the [Security Framework], the [Privacy Framework], the [Interoperable skill] and the [Interoperability governance]. The [Interoperability Governance] is under the responsibility of the [Interoperability Organisational Authority]. [Delegation of powers provisioning Digital Public Services] influences the [Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation] which is realised by the [Digitalisation Roadmap] that realises also the [Digital Agenda], that serves the [Interoperability Strategy]. [Digital Agenda] is associated with [Digital Governance], which, in turn, is associated with [Interoperability Framework], [Security Framework] and [Privacy Framework].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view show that [Data Policy] and its specialisation [Descriptive Metadata Policy], [Data Portability Policy], [Open Data Policy], [Master Data Policy], [Base Registry Data Policy] and [Reference Data Policy], together with the [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] are the mainstream of the solution governance at semantic level. Within the [Semantic governance Content] it is also considered that the [Semantic Interoperabilty Agreement] is a specialisation of a [Semantic Agreement].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view show [Technical Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Technical Agreement], which are the mainspring of the solution governance at technical level.</documentation>

      <documentation>The Semantic view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that should be considered to support semantic aspects for the End-to-End design of interoperable Digital Public Services. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Data] is serialised using [Data Representation] the treatment and contextualisation, drives [Data] and [Data Representation] into [Knowledge]. [Data] can be grouped into [Dataset], as [Dataset] aggregates [Data]. and can be described and aggregated in [Dataset Catalogue]. [Data] is linked to [Ontology], which can be described and aggregated into [Ontologies Catalogue]. [Data Mapping] aggregates [Data] and is described and aggregated into [Data Mapping Catalogue]. [Data Mapping] is also specialised in [Metadata Catalogue], [Data Syntax Mapping Catalogue], and [Software Components Catalogue].  [Distributed Ledger] is associated to [Data] supporting the sharing and recording of encrypted data across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. [Virtual Dataset] aggregates [Dataset], that can be specialised in [Reference Data] and [Master Data]. [Base Registry] is composed of [Master Data]. [Data] can be represented as [Linked Data] and [Open Data], which are specialisations of [Data]. The representation [Linked Open Data] is a specialisation of both [Open Data] and [Linked Data]. [Linked Data] can be distributed by [Linked Open Event Stream], which is a specialisation of it. [Hash Code] and [Metadata] specialise [Data]. [Metadata] is at the same time, specialised by [Data Model], which is composed of [Forms Structure] and [Data Format], and aggregates [Data Syntax]. [Controlled Vocabulary] is a specialisation of [Data Model]. [Data] has a specific [Data Owner] that is responsible for its management, together with [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Provider Provider] and all negotiate and reach a [Semantic Agreement] and/or a [Semantic Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of [Semantic Agreement]. [Data] is subject to [Data Policy], which has specific cases that are [Master Data Policy], [Security Policy], [Privacy Policy], [Data Portability Policy], and [Open Data Policy].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Semantic Functional content] and [Semantic Governance Content], both are aggregated with [Semantic Knowledge Content]. </documentation>

      <documentation>The Technical Infrastructure view models the most salient cross-sectorial infrastructure services that need to be considered to support technical aspects for the infrastructure (i.e. computing hosting, networking, and data hosting) for the End-to-End design of interoperable Digital Public Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
In the same way, as it happens in the Technical Application view, the [Technical Governance Content], the [Technical Agreement], and its specialisations [Tech Interoperability Agreement] and [Service Level Agreement] constitute the [Technical Governance Content] and influence the whole [Technical Infrastructure Functional Content]. Both, [Technical Governance Content] and [Technical Infrastructure Functional Content] are aggregated by the [Shared Infrastructure Content]. The infrastructure is located in a [Facility Location] and hosted using a [Hosting Facility]. [Hosting Facility] is realised by [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. The capabilities of a [Hosting Facility] are supported by a set of physical (in place) elements: [Physical Computing Infrastructure], [Physical Network Infrastructure], [Physical Communication Infrastructure], [Physical Power Supply Infrastructure] and [Physical Security Infrastructure]. [Analytics Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Analytics Technology Service], [Business Intelligence Technology Service], [Databricks Technology Service], and [Data Catalog Technology Service]. The [Artificial Intelligence infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Machine Learning Technology Service]. [Digital Workplace Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Remote Desktop Technology Service]. [Management Infrastructure Enablers] includes four elements aggregated [Logger Technology Service], [Audit Manager Technology Service], [Telemetry Technology Service] and [Management Console Technology Service]. [Application Integration Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates a set of technology services to facilitate integration in organisations and are [Enterprise Service Bus Technology Service], [Event Manager Technology Service], [API Manager Technology Service], which is aggregated by an [API Gateway Technology Service], also [Serverless Orchestrator Technology Service], [GraphQL Server Technology Service] and [Application Service]. [Content Delivery Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Web Server Technology Service] and [Streaming Server Technology Service]. [Process Orchestration Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Business Process Manager Technology Service]. The [Database Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Relational Database Manager Technology Service], [Object-Oriented Database Manager Technology Service], [NoSQL Database Manager Technology Service], [Graph Database Manager Technology Service], and [Database Cache Manager Technology Service]. [Storage Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [File Storage Technology Service], [Block Storage Technology Service], [Backup Technology Service], and [Distributed File System Technology Service]. [Data Lake Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Data Lake Storage Technology Service]. The [Identity and Access Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Identity Provider Technology Service], [Federated Identity Provider Technology Service], and [Lightweight Directory Access Technology Service]. [Trust Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [PKI Certificate Manager Technology Service]. [Blockchain Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Inmutable Database Manager Technology Service], [Blockchain Ledger Technology Service], and [Distributed Blockchain Network Technology Service]. [Containers Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Container Orchestrator Technology Service] is aggregated by [Containers Manager Technology Service], which is associated to [Container Registry Technology Service], and [Container]. [Networking Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Virtual Private Network Technology Service], [Gateway Technology Service], [Domain Name Service Technology Service], and a [Router Technology Service] associated to a [Private Network], composed by a [Private Subnetwork], associated to [Firewall], which is associated to [Load Balancer Technology Service]. [Computing Infrastructure Enablers] is composed with [Virtual Machine] node. [Virtual Machine] specialise a [Server] node. [On Premise Facility] and [Cloud Computing Facility] specialise [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. [On Premise Facility] includes [Local Area Network]. [Cloud Computing Facility] is associated with [SaaS], which is composed of [PaaS], and [PaaS] is composed of [IaaS]. The [IaaS] includes [Cloud Private Network]. [Hybrid Cloud Facility] and [Edge Computing] aggregate both [On Premise Facility], and [Cloud Computing Facility]. Also, [On Premise Facility] and [Cloud Computing Facility] are served by [Wide Area Networking], which aggregates [Secure Public Network], specialised by [Public Network]. [Additional Area Networking] includes several associations that can be established with external services, facilities or devices, for instance [External Facility], [External Service], [Desktop Computer], [Smart Device], [Sensor], [Remote Desktop Client]. &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Technical Infrastructure Functional content] and [Technical Governance content].</documentation>

      <documentation>The Technical Application view models the most salient application Architecture Building Blocks that need to be considered to support technical aspects for the End-to-End design of interoperable Digital Public Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Interoperable Digital Solution] aggregates [Shared Platform], and provides access to data and services. The [Interoperable Digital Solution] includes [Machine to Machine Interface] with [Human Interface], which both realise [Digital Public Service Delivery], which assign [Digital Public Service], which realize [Digital Business Capability]. Also [Machine to Machine Interface] and [Human Interface] assign [Digital Solution Service] which is realised by [Digital Solution Component]. [Interoperable Digital Solution] is influenced by [Technical Agreement], and its specialisation [Tech Interoperability Agreement] and [Service Level Agreement], all three elements constitute [Technical Governance Content].   &#xD;
&#xD;
[Shared Platform] includes [API Enablers] to register the system services in which [Web Service] which is a specialisation of [API], as well as [Machine to Machine Interface]. [API Catalogue Component] realises [API Discovery and Catalogue Service] which associate with [API Catalogue] which associate with [API]. [Service Registry] is associate with (is a) [Web Service] and [Service Discovery and Registry Service] which realized by [Service Registry Component]. Orchestration Enablers in which [Orchestration Component] realises [Orchestration Service]. Security Enablers in which [Audit Component] realises [Audit Service]. [Security Enablers] include a subset of Identification and Access Enablers where [Identification Component] realises [Authentication Service], [Request Validation Service], [Registration Service], and [Access Management Component] realises [Access Management Service] and its specialisations [Identity Management Service], [Authorisation Service], and the [Accounting Service]. [Test Enablers] in which [Conformance Testing Component] accesses [Conformance Test Scenario] and performs [Conformance Testing Service]. Trust between systems is established with Identity management is realised with [Trust Enablers] in which [Trust Service Provisioning Component] realises [e-Signature Creation Service],[e-signature Verification and Validation Service],[e-signature Preservation Service], [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service], [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-Timestamp Verification and Validation Service], [Registered Electronic Delivery Service] and [Integrity Verification Service]. Also [Blockchain Component] realises [Blockchain Service]. In [Data Exchange Enablers] exist [Data Exchange Component] which realises [Data Exchange Service]. In [Data Management Enablers] exist the [Metadata Management Component] realises [Metadata Management Service]. [e-Archiving Component] realises [e-Archiving Service]. [Data Management Component] realises [Data Management Service]. [Forms Management Component] realises [Content Management Service] and [Forms Management Service]. [Data Publication Component] realises [Data Publication Service]. [Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Component] realises [Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Service]. [Data Quality Component] realises [Data Quality Service]. [Data Persistence Component] realises [Data Persistence Service]. There is also the [Data Virtualization Component] that realises [Data Virtualization Service]. In [Privacy Enablers] exists the [Privacy Component], which realises the [Privacy Service]. In [Knowledge Discovery Enablers] the [Knowledge Discovery Component] realises [Knowledge Discovery Component Service] which is associated with [Knowledge Triple stone]. In [Analytics Enablers] [Data Analytics Component] realises [Data Analytics Service]. In [Artificial Intelligence] the [Artificial Intelligent Component] realises [Artificial Intelligent Service]. [Translation Enablers] enable the possibility to increase the accessibility to public service through [Machine Translation Component] that realises [Machine Translation Service]. In [Users Experience Management Enablers] the [Public Administration Single Window Component] realises [Public Administration Single Window Service]. In [Digital Workplace Enablers] exist [Digital Workplace Component] which realises [Digital Workplace Service]. In [Schedule Management Enablers] the [Schedule Management Component] realises [Schedule Management Service], and the [Agenda Management Component] realises [Agenda Management Service], which is a specialisation of [Schedule Management Service]. The [Data Space Enablers] includes the [Data Space] which aggregates [Data Space Connector], and it has two specialisations, which are the [Data Space Connector Provider] and [Data Space Connector Consumer].   &#xD;

      <documentation>The Legal view models the most salient public policy development enablers and implementation instruments that shall be considered to support the End-to-End design of interoperable digital public services. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
&#xD;
A [Public Policy] aims at addressing the needs of a group of stakeholders, and it is associated with a [Public Policy Objective]. The policy is formulated and realized with the help of [Legal Act] which has two specializations [European Legal Act] and [National Legal Act] in the form of [Binding Instrument] or [Non-Binding Instrument]. A key type of legislation for behavioural interoperability is the [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange], which is a specialization of a legal key enabler for the delivery of digital public services, the [Legislation on Digital Public Services]. Both are contained in [Legislation Catalogue], as they are specialisations. [Legislation Catalogue] include [Legal Act] and the different specialisations [European Legal Act] and [National Legal Act], and the different forms [Binding Instrument], and [Non-Binding Instrument]. The [Legal act] aggregates [Legal Clauses] and is realised by [Public Policy] and linked to the [Granularity of Legal Requirements]. [Public Policy] realises [Digital-ready Policymaking], and the same time [Public Policy Constraint] which is a specialisation of a [Public Policy Context] realises the [Public Policy]. [Public Policy] has associated a [Public Policy Objective] and [Delegation of Powers Provisioning Digital Public Services], which influences [Public Policy Context]. As part of the Legal Governance Content, [Legal Agreement] is specialised by [Legal Interoperability Agreement] focused on formalizing governance rules enabling collaboration between digital public services. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] can be reached at the European level [European Legal Interoperability Agreement] or the National level [National Legal Interoperability Agreement].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Legal Governance Content] and the [Legal Functional Content], which both are aggregated by [Shared Legal Content].</documentation>

      <documentation>The Organisational view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered to support organisational aspects for the End-to-End design of Digital Public Services.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Digital Public Service] is delivered according to its [Digital Public Service Delivery Model] and realises a [Digital Business Capability] by accessing [Information]. [Digital Public Service] is documented in [Digital Public Service Catalogue] that can be used among others with services portfolio management purposes. The [Digital Public Service Catalogue] aggregates the [Shared Organisational Content] as the [Organisational Agreement] and the [Digital Public Service Delivery Model]. [Digital Public Service Delivery Model] assigns/aggregates [Digital Public Service Delivery Machine Agent] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Human Agent] both serving a role [Agent]. [Agent] is specialised by stakeholders [Individual] and [Legal Entity], which is the specialisation of another stakeholder [Organisation]. [Organisation] is also specialised by stakeholders such as [Business] and [Public Administration]. An [Agent] can serve both relations, as [Digital Public Service Consumer] and [Digital Public Service Provider]. Both roles are assigned with the business function [Digital Public Service Provision]. [Organisational Agreement], which is specialised in [Organisational Interoperability Agreement]. [Digital Governance Plan] is composed by contracts [Agreement on Provision of Digital Public Services], [Agreement on Interoperability Security] which is associated to [Security Framework], the [Agreement on Privacy] associated to [Privacy Framework], the [Agreement on Data Sharing] and [Agreement of the Use on Common Infrastructure] both associated to [Interoperability Framework]. [Digital Governance Plan] realises the [Digital Agenda] that influences the [Interoperability Strategy]. [Digital Agenda] is realised by a [Digitalisation Roadmap], which developing the constraint [Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation]. [Data Owner] is a business role that signs or agrees upon [Organisational Agreement] that realises the constraint [Means for Public Policy Objectives Convergence Assurance and Control]. On the delivery of the [Digital Public Service] a [Digital Public Service Delivery] business interface is assigned to the [Digital Public Service], and the business interface can have different modalities such as [Web App], [Mobile App], [Desktop App], [Service App], and [Adaptive Configuration].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Organisational Governance content] and [Organisational Functional content], both aggregated with [Shared Organisational Content]. Each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, which is realised by a [Solution Building Block]. </documentation>

[Analysis of a target digital public solution] groups the following ABBs: [Interoperability Dimension] which is associated with the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] requirement. the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] composes the [EIRA View], which is associated with the [EIF Interoperability Level], aggregates the [EIRA Viewpoint] and is a specialization of the [Key Interoperability Enabler] and [Architecture Building Block] which in turn adds granularity to the [Detail - level Architecture Requirement]. The [Detail - level Architecture Requirement] is a specialist ion of the [Interoperability Requirement] which aggregates all the [Interoperability Aspects]. [Analysis of a target digital public solution] is influenced by [Architecture Principle] which is a specialization of the [EIF Principle] and aggregates the [European Library of Architecture Principle]. [Architecture Principle] influences also the [Solution design of a target digital public service / Documentation of an existing digital public service] which is composed by the [EIRA Solution Building Block] that realizes the [Interoperability Specification] and specializes the [Solution Building Block] that, in turn, is composed by the [Digital Solution] which realizes the [Interoperable Digital Solution]. The [Solution Building Block] realizes the [Solution Specification] that is a specialization of the [Interoperability Specification] which aggregates the [EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications].</documentation>

  <purpose>This file provides the ArchiMate model of the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA2) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the End to End design of interoperable digital public service. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed for the delivery of digital public services, realise digital business capabilties for public administrations and promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. The EIRA is a Service Oriented Architecture and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF). 

The latest release of the EIRA is available on Joinup: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eia/description 
The latest release of the new EIF is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en</purpose>
